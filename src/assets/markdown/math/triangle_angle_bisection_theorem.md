If an angle of a triangle is bisected and the straight line that cuts the angle in half is cutting the base as well, the segments of the base will have the same ratio as the remaining sides of the triangle. $\Leftrightarrow$ If the segments of the base have the same ratio as the remaining sides of the triangle, the straight line joined from the vertex to the point of section will bisect the angle of the triangle.

Let there be $\triangle{ABC}$, and let $\angle{ACB} = \gamma$ be bisected by the straight line $DC$:

Let $\overline{BE}$ be drawn through $B$ so that $\overline{BE} \parallel \overline{DC}$ and let $\overline{AC}$ be carried out until it meets $\overline{BE}$ in $E$.

As described by [Vertical Angles](./angles.md#vertical-angles), since $\overline{DC} \parallel \overline{BE}$, $\angle{DCB} = \angle{EBC}$. Since $\angle{DCB}$ is by hypothesis equal to $\angle{ACD}$, $\angle{ACD} = \angle{EBC}$. Again, since $\overline{DC} \parallel \overline{BE}$, $\angle{ACD} = \angle{CEB}$. But $\angle{CBE}$ was proved to equal to $\angle{ACD}$, therefore $\angle{CBE} = \angle{CEB}$, so that

$\mathrm{I}$: $\overline{BC} = \overline{CE}$.

Since $\overline{DC}$ is parallel to $\overline{BE}$, one of the sides of $\triangle{ABE}$, therefore

$\mathrm{II}$: $\frac{\overline{AC}}{\overline{CE}} = \frac{\overline{AD}}{\overline{DB}}$

, as stated by the [Triangle Line Intersection Theorem](./triangle_line_intersection_theorem.md).

$\xRightarrow{\mathrm{I},\mathrm{II}} \frac{\overline{AC}}{\overline{BC}} = \frac{\overline{AD}}{\overline{DB}}$
