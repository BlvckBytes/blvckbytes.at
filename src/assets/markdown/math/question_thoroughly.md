No matter which concept or supposed truth may ever be encountered, if it finds itself based on well-formed definitions as well as a rigorous derivation, all questioning and each attack from without shall be withstood. By accepting new knowledge without first tearing it into its atomic pieces, such that each can be examined closely and be agreed upon in an incremental manner, one does not expand their horizon solidly, but relies on trust and belief that what has been given to them resembles sound information, with faith being inherently weak and hard to use as a secure foundation.

The overwhelming majority of people who regularly share knowledge are comprised of teachers and professors of various kinds, which mostly have one property in common (with very few exceptions): they expect their opposites to behave as students, and as such, bear the personality of somebody who knows their supposed place and does not question what they are presented with, but rather accepts new concepts based on authority and the belief in the experience of their lecturer - a notion which is completely worthless when it comes to distinguishing truth.

Somebody who raises profound questions on a regular basis would stick out of a classroom like a sore thumb, repeatedly attracting the teacher's annoyance, for either they do not possess the corresponding answers themselves, or are simply not interested in educating people via solid foundations. Another, possibly additional cause could be the shortage of time, as is so ubiquitous within the bulk of schools and universities; this shortcoming once again hints at how we, as a species, horribly fail at conveying knowledge properly and most of all efficiently, as it should all be organized centrally, so that bright and committed students may soak up the details on their own, at home.

While the mentality of a student is ideal to bring up replaceable automata, doomed to support and extend a sick cycle called modern society, it is completely incompatible with bringing forth that which we need more than anything: intelligent and independent thinkers, which will revolutionalize the way we go about most of human endeavor, changing the life of everybody for the better. The latter requires the mentality of a researcher, whose only goal is to find the truth, who will not settle for less, continually striving to deepen their understanding, and broaden their horizon.

One of the many grand lies which is actively parrotted on a daily basis consists of the saying that the scientific progress of humanity exceeded a depth at which point it is no longer possible to understand any one discipline from its roots upwards, such that we may just give up and should simply "*stop trying to understand*"; I disagree with all of my life-force and believe this view to be detrimental to our future. It is not, and I mean by far not, the depth which is holding a single person back from becoming the master of all subjects, but rather the breadth, mostly concerning natural sciences; the maximum life expectancy, based on a steadily decaying body, merely doesn't suffice to learn everything which has been discovered in the past. But there is no reason for why - after one has picked a domain of highest interest onto which their main focus is shifted long-term - true and deep understanding, down to the very roots of said domain, should be impossible.

While in many areas of life, luck didn't necessarily follow in my wake, I have been immeasurably lucky to find the right information for both mental sciences named Mathematics as well as Computer Science, such that I know my above claim to be the truth; these journeys taught me to loose my fear of- and intimidation by concepts of arbitrary complexity, because I understood what it means to first gain a solid foundation, as complexity always comprises of less complex building-blocks, which - if dug deep enough - will be rooted into the very foundations of the domain at hand.

Arriving at such a point takes an indescribeable amount of time and effort, requires a lot of questioning, and - most importantly - the right sources of information, as well as the right teachers; the one and only job of a teacher is to accellerate the discovery-process for their students, as true knowledge, devoid of holes, can only be transferred via individual re-discovery. There is still much to learn, and he who thinks this process to be completable within a single lifetime is going to die an ignorant death.

I always dreamt to find these pieces of platonic and thus secure information, and now that I have gotten my foot into the door, I took a deep breath and tried to answer what exactly motivates me to continually drive myself up the steep slope of the mountain - what am I seeking to achieve? The ultimate goal is one of communal nature, which - as is always the case - has risen out of a personal aspiration: wanting to enable and unfold my own free will to the highest possible degree. If I do not know, first of all, which possibilities this physical realm is offering to me, and secondly, if I cannot execute all parts of a stepwise pathway to realizing my mental vision, I am not free - how can I be, if I cannot express myself without bounds? My awareness of this severe and rather serious limitation has been with me since very early on in life, giving rise to curiosity and a long-term, albeit fluctuating drive to research; I know how crippling it can feel at times, and I do not want to feel others this way too, which is why I want to contribute to the lessening of this shortcoming we are stuck in. Even though a possible way of doing so has been hovering around the back of my head for around two years now, I don't think I am yet ready for it, as there is still a lot of work pending in regards to my mental health first - one who is not at peace with themselves can hardly lead others into paradise.
