Triangles and parallelograms which are under the same height ($h$) are to one another as their bases.

Let $\triangle{ABC}$ and $\triangle{ACD}$ be triangles, and $AEBC$ and $FACD$ be parallelograms under the same height:

As the base $\overline{BC}$ is to the base $\overline{CD}$, so is the triangle $\triangle{ABC}$ to the triangle $\triangle{ACD}$, and the parallelogram $AEBC$ to the parallelogram $FACD$.

Let $\overline{BD}$ be produced in both directions to the points $H$ and $L$, and let $\overline{BG}$ and $\overline{GH}$ be made equal to the base $\overline{CB}$ and $\overline{DK}$ and $\overline{KL}$ be made equal to the base $\overline{CD}$. Then, let $\overline{GA}$, $\overline{HA}$, $\overline{KA}$ and $\overline{LA}$ be joined. Note that $H$ and $L$ are multiples of $\overline{CB}$ from $B$ and multiples of $\overline{CD}$ from $D$, in distance respectively, and that this factor can be arbitrarily high.

Since $\overline{CB}$, $\overline{BG}$ and $\overline{GH}$ are equal to one another, the triangles $\triangle{ABC}$, $\triangle{AGB}$ and $\triangle{AHG}$ are also equal to one another.

Therefore, whatever multiple the base $\overline{HC}$ is of the base $\overline{BC}$, that multiple also is $\triangle{AHC}$ of $\triangle{ABC}$. For the same reason, whatever multiple the base $\overline{LC}$ is of the base $\overline{CD}$, that multiple also is $\triangle{ACL}$ of $\triangle{ACD}$.

$\mathrm{I}$: If the base $\overline{HC}$ is equal to the base $\overline{CL}$, $\triangle{AHC}$ is also equal to $\triangle{ACL}$. If $\overline{HC}$ is in excess of the base $\overline{CL}$, $\triangle{AHC}$ is also in excess of $\triangle{ACL}$. And if less, less.

Thus, there are four magnitudes: Bases $\overline{BC}$ and $\overline{CD}$, as well as $\triangle{ABC}$ and $\triangle{ACD}$. (It could also be said that for this relation, there are three degrees of freedom: $\overline{BC}$ and $\overline{CD}$, as well as the figures' common height $h$.) Equimultiples have been taken of base $\overline{BC}$ and $\triangle{ABC}$, namely $\overline{HC}$ and $\triangle{AHC}$, and of base $\overline{CD}$ and $\triangle{ACD}$, namely $\overline{CL}$ and $\triangle{ACL}$.

It has been proved, that: $\mathrm{I}$. $\Rightarrow$ As the base $\overline{BC}$ is to the base $\overline{CD}$, so is $\triangle{ABC}$ to $\triangle{ACD}$.

$\mathrm{II}$: Next, since the parallelogram $AEBC$ is double of $\triangle{ABC}$, and the parallelogram $FACD$ is double of $\triangle{ACD}$, while parts have the same ratio as the same multiples of them, as $\triangle{ABC}$ is to $\overline{ACD}$, so is the parallelogram $AEBC$ to the parallelogram $FACD$.

$\xRightarrow{\mathrm{I},\mathrm{II}}$ As base $\overline{BC}$ is to base $\overline{CD}$, so is the parallelogram $AEBC$ to the parallogram $FACD$.
