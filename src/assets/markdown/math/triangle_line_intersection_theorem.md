If a straight line drawn parallel to one of the sides of a triangle, it will cut the remaining sides of the triangle proportionally. $\Leftrightarrow$ If the remaining sides of the triangle be cut proportionally, the line joining the points of intersection will be parallel to the remaining side of the triangle.

Consider the following triangle $\triangle{ABC}$:

Let the line-segment $\overline{DE}$ be drawn on any height, so that

$\mathrm{I}$: $\overline{DE} \parallel \overline{AB}$:

$\mathrm{II}$: $\xRightarrow{\mathrm{I}} \overline{AD} = \overline{BE}$

Let the line-segments $\overline{BD}$ join $B$ and $D$, while $\overline{AE}$ joins $A$ and $E$:

$\mathrm{III}$: $\xRightarrow{\mathrm{I,II}} \overline{AE} = \overline{BD}$

Since $\triangle{AED}$ and $\triangle{BED}$ share the segment $\overline{DE}$, as well as because of $\mathrm{II}$ and $\mathrm{III}$:

$\mathrm{IV}$: $\triangle{AED} \cong \triangle{BED}$

Equals have the same ratio to the same, therefore $\triangle{AED}$ is to $\triangle{DEC}$ as $\triangle{BED}$ is to $\triangle{DEC}$. But as $\triangle{AED}$ is to $\triangle{DEC}$, so is $\overline{AD}$ to $\overline{DC}$, for being under the same height $\overline{DE}$, they are to one another as their bases ([Triangles Base Relations](./triangles_parallelograms_base_relations.md)). Similarly, as $\triangle{BED}$ is to $\triangle{DEC}$, so is $\overline{BE}$ to $\overline{EC}$.

$\mathrm{V}$: $\xRightarrow{\mathrm{IV}} \frac{\overline{AD}}{\overline{DC}} = \frac{\overline{BE}}{\overline{EC}}$

Analogously, since $\triangle{ABD}$ and $\triangle{ABE}$ share the segment $\overline{AB}$, as well as because of $\mathrm{II}$ and $\mathrm{III}$:

$\mathrm{VI}$: $\triangle{ABD} \cong \triangle{ABE}$
