## Welcome

Greetings! Feel free to take a gander at what little content I currently have to offer.

This site mostly serves as a creative outlet for myself and is **not** intended to be a "professional portfolio" (far from that, actually). I am, and will likely always be, an amateur scientist, so please don't be offended by my lacking ability of formulating rigorously correct documents.

I am adding pages and content whenever I feel the urge to and have the required time left.

INFO: By now, there have been multiple cases of people who came across this page wanting to get in touch via email; each time, their inquiry got auto-flagged as spam, drowned in the sea of ads I so regularly receive and has been deleted after 30 days. If you're serious about exchanging a few words, please use Discord in order to add me as `blvckbytes`.

## Quick Links

### GitHub

I use this platform as a way to backup and version my projects: whatever seems worthy of keeping ends up on there. On my early journey, I've spent countless hundreds of hours on minecraft plugin development, which is why some libraries are directed towards making this process easier. Not long after I've discovered philosophy, and thereby a host of prevailing miseries of high importance, I could no longer bear to "waste" my limited time on a game, which is why I've left this hobby behind.

### YouTube Account

While I'd love to one day start a YouTube-channel (even if this platform and it's holders are nothing short of a cesspool), I haven't yet done so, which is why I'm only attaching the channel here so you can take a look at my playlists (music, etc.) if you happened to be interested in such things.
