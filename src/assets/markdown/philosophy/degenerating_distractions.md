## Overview

In order to outline the subject of this article, I'd like to extend the quote

"All paid employment absorbs and degrades the mind." - Aristotle

as follows

"All paid employment **as well as all institutional education** absorbs and degrades the mind."

since they both share the same underlying effect: they distract the individual from rising above the severely restrictive ideas of its time, thereby preventing it from becoming part of the *solution*, rather remaining part of the *problem*.

Attaining well-formed ideas and concepts, as well as to formulate and possibly even realize or instantiate them later on takes a lot of mental effort and thought, which again takes a lot of time; not only that, but moving into the right [Layer Of Consciousness](philosophy/free-will-dampening#layers-of-consciousness) is an act of concentration and meditation - one which cannot occur during restless moments. It's not a surprise that most great philosophers who contributed great knowledge and wisdom were liberated from the hamster-wheel and could freely exercise their mental capacities.

"...; so hat dagegen der mit überwiegenden Geisteskräften ausgestattete Mensch ein gedankenreiches, durchweg belebtes und bedeutsames Daseyn: würdige und interessante Gegenstände beschäftigen ihn, >**sobald er sich ihnen überlassen darf**<, und in sich selbst trägt er eine Quelle der edelsten Genüsse." - Arthur Schopenhauer

("...; thereby the with mostly mental abilities equipped human leads a stay rich in thought that's thoroughly enlivened: worthy and interesting topics are of interest to him, >**if he's priviledged to surrender to them**<, and in himself he carries a source of most noble pleasures." - Arthur Schopenhauer)

No matter which occupation burdens the individual, their days will degenerate into the following worthless loop:

- Waking up
- Getting the occupation over with
- Coming home
- Practising escapism and various other bad habits
- Going to sleep
- Repeat

This way, the inherent skill of independent reasoning remains mostly unused, and thereby slowly withers away, making the individual appear to evolve backwards, as it looses potential and ability. Due to the ever sinking density of fulfilling experiences, life seems to pass by rather quickly; until one day, retirement is entered, and the individual is being faced with what it has become. Dull senses and boredom are displaced by various sensations money can buy, but the lack of purpose will be taken to the grave.

## Paid Employment


In reality, only very few employees derive a sense of fulfillment and purpose from their occupation; most who talk themselves into this belief only do so as they use their job as a mean to escape from reality, from their true self, and became afraid of facing this fact. The illusion of having achieved purpose by serving someone else suffocates the drive to explore the self and to find true purpose, which reason and curiosity naturally exert. The subsequent need of having to earn money in order to finance even the most modest way of living on this earth makes it impossible for many to question this dogma, as their existence depends on it. One's free will has been greatly restricted, as it is no longer a decision, but became an imposement. It does not matter whether the worker stands behind the cause of their employer or whether they are interested in the company goals, all that matters is that they complete their assigned tasks within a predetermined deadline. The individual is being utilized by force, and has thereby been disposed of a great deal of potential as well as valuable lifetime. Due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome" target="_blank">Stockholm Syndrome</a>, people tend to defend the status quo, even if they are the ones being exploited by it.

## Institutional Education

When it comes to institutional education, it often is the case that their teachings only unfold their usefulness within an arbitrarily constructed, unrealistic environment; likely due to egotistical reasons on part of its instructors and overall heritage. Many students are gathered infront of a single educator who - even if they'd have the desire to - cannot account for each and everybody in the room, thereby making assumptions, leaving out crucial details and exceeding the maximum speed of information-intake some members can bring to the table. Less-than-ideal learning material further causes the students to reduce their individuality, their curiosity as well as their critical thinking skills; information is only to be taken in, not to be questioned. A multitude of exams and homework are supposed to ensure that the individual understood the subject-matter, when in reality, their short-term comprehension will fade away soon after. Once completed in its entirety, a socially accepted testimonial paper is handed out, which assures the illusionary belief of having mastered the present field.

These students have not been provided with platonic knowledge ([Platonism](#platonism)), and can thereby not take part in contributing to any scientific fields reliably ([Reliable Science](#reliable-science)), without first having to study the details as well as to unlearn some of either the oversimplifications or just the plainly wrong statements they have so greatly been bombarded with.

## Platonism

"Platonism is the view that there exist such things as abstract objects, where an abstract object is entirely non-physical, inanimate and independent of the mind of any sentient being. Abstract objects, being inanimate, have always existed and continue to exist, whether any sentient being ever thinks about the same. Abstract objects which are well-formed are called "perfect concepts", or preferably "noumena" (non-mental). In fact, the idea of existence of any abstract object is inextricably tied to its well-formedness. For example, the Elements of Euclid are perfect concepts or noumena that are indeed very well-formed abstract objects, meaning they have always existed. Platonism is the only worthwhile philosophy and it is how the Ancient Greeks realised all of their sound mathematics. In fact, without philosophy, there would be no realisation of any other knowledge or science. Philosophy is the *king* of all knowledge." - John Gabriel

## Reliable Science

"Ob die Bearbeitung der Erkenntnisse, die zum Vernunftgeschäfte gehören, den sicheren Gang einer Wissenschaft gehe oder nicht, das läßt sich bald aus dem Erfolg beurteilen. Wenn sie nach viel gemachten Anstalten und Zurüstungen, sobald es zum Zweck kommt, in Stecken gerät oder, um diesen zu erreichen, öfters wieder zurückgehen und einen anderen Weg einschlagen muß; imgleichen wenn es nicht möglich ist, die verschiedenen Mitarbeiter in der Art, wie die gemeinschaftliche Absicht erfolgt werden soll, einhellig zu machen: so kann man immer überzeugt sein, daß ein solches Studium bei weitem noch nicht den sicheren Gang einer Wissenschaft eingeschlagen, sondern ein bloßes Herumtappen sei, und es ist schon ein Verdienst um die Vernunft, diesen Weg wo möglich ausfindig zu machen, sollte auch manches als vergeblich aufgegeben werden müssen, was in dem ohne Überlegung vorger genommenen Zwecke enthalten war." - Immanuel Kant

("Whether processing finings, which is part of what reason deals with, has taken the path of a stable and reliable science or not, that can quickly be determined by its success. If it, after having established many institutions and equipments, when it comes to its application, stalls, or to reach it, has to repeatedly go back and take another route; similarly, when it is not possible to unite its employees about how their communal intentions are to be carried out: one may always rest assured, that such a study has not yet, by far, taken the path of a stable and reliable science and is nothing but fumbling around in the dark. It is definitely a duty of reason itself to uncover and establish this path whereever possible, even if many establishments are to be given up in vain, as having been part of a previous mean without proper thought." - Immanuel Kant)
