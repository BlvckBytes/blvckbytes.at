This page resembles a brain- and heart-dump of my own and tries to explain my thoughts on the situation, while capturing some ideas for a solution along the way. These ideas are by no means final, and the project has not yet been even begun properly. It's a long-term goal that will not only take it's time, but also go through multiple iterations.

## Definitions

At first, I want to define a few terms, as they've become quite loaded within modern society, and I do *not* identify with these ironed-over meanings.

### Minorities

Whenever I talk about minorities, I'm considering those that have a hard time trying to fit into society, and thus often times end up lonely or even isolated.

While I - of course - want to help *all* minorities to connect to eachother, I'm mostly thinking about those who bear uncommon character traits and just behave differently. People who look differently, have altered anatomy, birth defects, are impaired, had an accident, etc. didn't get to choose, they are faced with reality and need to come to terms with it. No sane person would argue otherwise.

On the other hand, many like to believe that one *has* a choice on how they behave, what opinions they stand behind and thus whether they fit into society or not. I strongly disagree. While it certainly is possible to decide to ignore your conscience, your heart and your inner voice, decisions like these always lead to a very sad and depressed life, as the omnipresent cognitive dissonance will drive a being insane over a long-enough time period. The common phrase of "once you've seen it, you cannot un-see it" hits the nail on its head, since as soon as one has discovered a niche of their interest and maybe even some ethical problems which are attached to it, it becomes nearly impossible to leave this space again. Due to the fact that our world is full of these ethical problems and rabbit-holes, and because each person is faced with different manifestations first and only has a limited capacity for problems to deal with and work on, different people fight to resolve different dilemmas.

Instead of trying to invalidate the personal missions of others, one should rather try to see their true character, acknowledge their scars as well as their story and - if they do not want to help - at least not block their way by any means.

### Being Awake

This simple character trait has arguably been dragged through the mud the most in recent years, under the umbrella-term of being "woke". Again, I do not identify with such cancel-culture at all, and define the term simply as follows: To have woken up from the dream, the stage-play others call day-to-day life, where all you constantly think about are superficial goals of no meaning whatsoever. A person that's awake is being distinguished by the fact that they ask profound questions, are always curious, bring a thirst for knowledge and don't ever take anything as a given. "Question everything" would be the motto. Exploring rabbit-holes, deriving insights from scratch and experimenting within various fields of science and art is what drives them all throughout life. Analogously, once this state has been attained, it cannot be left behind anymore.

### Mental Isolation

Mental isolation differes from the isolation known from being an inmate to a prison, as the latter is obvious and can be grasped by everybody, but the former is much more subtle and can go unnoticed by others for an entire lifetime. While we would all agree that somebody who is physically isolated is likely to be lonely and pitiable, the same does not hold true for mental isolation. Somebody could be interacting with dozens of people on a daily basis, in - for example - a workplace environment, see people on the train, tram, bus and streets, even have a family at home, and yet still feel mentally isolated, as all of these interactions do not go beyond a certain threshold of depth. They have nobody to share their true beliefs, long-term goals and dreams with, because nobody within their reach would understand them, and being misunderstood can be even more painful than being mentally isolated. I claim that there are a lot of very deeply developed and highly interesing personalities out there, which have yet to be discovered by those who have the ability to see them, dwelling in their mental prisons.

Being mentally isolated has a direct impact on one's personality, even to the most resilient of us, and thus becomes a real problem, screaming for a real solution. I'd like to cite a statement from within the game *Cry Of Fear*, which sums this experience up perfectly:

### Isolation By Choice

A common take, one that I've also experienced personally, is that people who experience [Mental Isolation](#definitions_mental-isolation) are at fault themselves, as they just didn't open up to anybody and chose to remain in their little snail-shell, so to speak. I want to clear this misconception up, which can only arise from those who lack empathy and emotional intelligence.

As herd-animals, we humans inherently want to connect with one another. The strive to be noticed, understood and accepted lives within our DNA, there's no argument to be had there. It's not like people don't try to socialize, or they're against opening up to somebody if a certain level of trust has been established, but rather that they have been burned so, so many times before that the pain of being betrayed, disappointed and misunderstood outgrew the pain of mental isolation. But still, the hope to one day find that special somebody who will just get, accept and support them as they are never extinguishes, even if the flame is crushed into a smaller and smaller footprint as life goes on. A kind of deadlock situation arises, as people who could be there for eachother now mutually wait for their opponent to show some special signs which indicate true understanding, signs they cannot show because they themselves are hurting and unsettled. While the information age helps to alleviate this predicament, by increasing self-confidence through anonymity, there's still not only a lot of trolling going on, but it's nonetheless next-to-impossible to find likeminded companions, as they're the needle within the haystack.

### Trait-Protective Isolation

This type of isolation is a fully conscious choice, but not only done because the pain of disappointments outgrew the pain of [Mental Isolation](#definitions_mental-isolation), but because the one practising it is aware of some very rare and special character-traits of their own, which would be molded away by others who just don't get them. Since the state of a being, and thus its properties, are the sum of their experiences in life, it is important to filter these experiences in order to not loose some desired properties in the long run. As these properties often times act as a mirror to those who do not want to reflect on their own lives, they tend to actively want to diminish them within other people. Substantial opinions and long-term goals may become watered down over time, if others are actively trying to talk them out of you. This is the reason for why it is better to be alone, than to be with the wrong people.

I want to give a concrete example for the above type, one that's very dear to my heart, one that I'm especially familiar with. Let's consider somebody who intuitively had a rejective attitude towards all varieties of drugs since the day they've learned about their existence. Even though it is very hard to keep this stance upright, as people are immensely pushy and become judgemental once their idea of the fun of life is not met, this person still had their own back all along and stayed true to themselves, not giving in to the pressure, mental manipulation as well as exclusion society brought upon them. Later on, this intuition turned into something greater, into a logically coherent decision that opened a completely new world and offers new possibilities as well as experiences, experiences unmatched by the effects of behavior-altering substances. Would it have been possible to retain the same level of self-consonance if it wasn't for trait-protective isolation, for the act of consciously withholding onself from those of negative influence, from energy-vampires? While there are many people out there who like to argue, who like to publicly stand in for their opinions and decisions, there are also many who're not that thick-skinned, and maybe even don't want to be, as a thick skin does not only protect, but also dulls the senses. This person knew about all of this, and made their decisions knowingly. Was it worth it, was it the right thing? This decision is up to the individual, and nobody else but the individual.

## The Problem

Minorities of all extents have a hard time to find likeminded companions, and the more one gets to know themselves, the more special character-traits they develop, the more they start [Being Awake](#definitions_being-awake), the narrower the spectrum of potential companions becomes. Due to this relation, it is highly unlikely that matching people will just meet in day-to-day situations, as the number of people who can be reached that way is very small when considering the small chance of a match.

As with all low probability distributions, these minorities are scattered all throughout the population, which in effect weakens them by a great deal, as they're always the odd one out, always being alienated, and start to question their own nature. There is nobody to turn to, nobody to derive self-confidence from. Furthermore, since you cannot judge a book by it's cover, you cannot tell who matches your character-traits just by looking at them with the naked eye, out in public. These minorities would need to make themselves known, so that other members can reach out and contact them. Due to [Trait-Protective Isolation](#definitions_trait-protective-isolation), they cannot do that, as they would otherwise be attacked and disheartened by people out of broad society who also got wind of this self-advertisement, so to speak.

Thereby, all that remains is the hope of encountering harmonious beings by mere choice, which is of too low probability to be even considered a solution, as still too many are suffering on a day-to-day basis.

## Solution Proposal

Personalities are of paramount complexity and can only be described in an approximative manner. In my opinion, the most fitting way to do so, is to make use of *tags*. These have also been dragged through the mud by modern society, as so many things have, by calling people who try to tag their personality as closely as possible "special snowflakes". These superficial statements are to be ignored, while a proper platform that supports complex tagging is to be constructed, satisfying the following requirements:

Again, due to [Trait-Protective Isolation](#definitions_trait-protective-isolation), one requirement will for certain be anonymity. It'll be a challenge to make this requirement not coincide with a flood of dead, fake and bot account registrations. An email will not be enough, at least a unique phone-number, used only for sending codes to, will be required. Blocklists of spam-numbers need to be tracked as well.

### Tags

Next up, tags need to be centrally managed, as people tend to make spelling mistakes, use synonyms, attach spaces or various symbols and thus segment one and the same tag into multiple representations, which is defying the main idea. If a tag is truly missing, a proposal needs to be checked by a human being, to then be either added to the tag space, or be declined, by showing the requestee which tag, already in existence, accomodates their character trait.

To iteratively flesh out specificity, tags need to be nestable. The parent tag is less specific than it's children and only provides a direction, while it's subordinates go into more detail. Let's look at an example:

```
- Physical Exercise
  - Riding The Bike
  - Hiking
  - Swimming
  - Running
```

The above depicts a person that likes to participate in physical exercise, and then states a few particular activities to be more specific. Now, all people who like physical exercise can be filtered for, or all people who specifically like to ride the bike. Parents can be collapsed when rendered, to quickly skim through profiles.

These exercise activities should have application domains, so that illogical trees can be avoided, as in:

```
- Learning New Languages
  - Swimming
```

While globally common details can be added anywhere, as follows:

```
- Mathematics
  - Algebra
  - Number Theory
  - Geometry
    - Since: 2015
  - Analysis
    - Since: 2023
```

The above would depict a person that likes mathematics, which is very familiar with geometry, but only recently picked up analysis.

From these examples, a specific set of tags and datatypes can be derived. All tags have a name, a short description, a long description (markdown page), an icon, a publicly-visible flag (non-public means liked profiles only) and a list of children. They can belong to a tag-group, which itself has a name, descriptions as well as an icon, and a color (which it's members will inherit). Next to that, each tag has an application domain, which is in essence just a list of allowed parent tags (and maybe even transitive parents) as well as allowed sibling tags. All other properties are listed below.

```
DateTimeTag { name: String, value: DateTime }
IntegerTag { name: String, value: Int }
DoubleTag { name: String, value: Double }
IntegerIntervalTag { name: String, lowerBound: Int, upperBound: Int }
DoubleIntervalTag { name: String, lowerBound: Double, upperBound: Double }
FlagTag { name: String }
TextTag { name: String, value: String }
CoordinatesTag { name: String, longitude: Double, latitude: Double }
```

With the above, it should already be possible to depict a great deal of information, while the `CoordinatesTag` may be used to provide a nearby location that the author is comfortable sharing with others, which represents their approximate place of residence. This system is always extendable with new tag-types, if the need arises.

A user who attaches tags to their profile can add references to tags in their free-text profile description, so that further elaboration and clarification may take place. If a tag is referenced within free-text, it cannot be removed until that reference has been deleted again.

### Templates And Generation

While these tags can quickly be dragged and dropped, in a terminal-block like manner, it may still take some time and be confusing at first, which is where templates and auto-generation through natural language, using a LLM, could come in handy. Next to that, auto-completion as well as context aware suggestions are going to be key for efficiently entering these trees into the system.

This is one of the goals for very late down the road, which is why it hasn't yet been given too much attention.

### Queries And Quests

Fuzzy matching will be where this idea truly shines. Queries represent a set of requirements, where each requirement may fuzzily match tag sub-trees to any arbitrary precision, and requirements can be `and`-ed and `or`-ed together. Various comparison operators can be applied to tag values in order to make searches even more specific. A quest then becomes an automated query, where the quest client will be notified whenever new matches have been detected, while a list of matches will be available at all times. Quests can be named, so a single person can search for various different personalities, based on different goals. If no longer needed, quests can be deactivated temporarily, rather than being deleted, as building them takes time and they may come in handy in the future again.

### Auxiliary Functionality

There are a few simple and common features which are crucial for success, that are also to be mentioned.

- Person-to-person chat system
- Multi-section free-text profile description
- Main profile picture and secondary images
- Profile banner picture
- Profiles can be liked, mutual liking is a "match"
- Discover page with query- and quest builders

These seem to be the bare minimum to allow for people to connect on this platform. It is *not* intended to be yet another social network, with feeds, comments and all of that jazz. People are supposed to discover each other, make the first steps, and then take their business somewhere else, like email, whatsapp, discord, signal, you name it. Profile like counts are not publicly visible, as there's no competition to be had.
