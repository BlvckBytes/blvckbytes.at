## Overview

It doesn't matter whether the individual is able to practise what we think about as "free will", since one of the main properties of philosophy is that the implications of a concept may be explored to any degree of detail, no matter whether the premise actually applies. This way, when discovering multiple branches of the tree, an edjucated guess can be made, which is to be preferred over complete uncertainty. From here on out, the existence of free will is assumed.

If a conscious being could act out on its free will to the full extent at each and every decision, there would be no room for regret and cognitive dissonance, as each part of the path has been built with all that was available at its point in time, and all actions were always aligned with the self. Yet, everybody is plagued by these negative emotions, which suggests that the ability to freely decide can be tarnished by certain factors, factors which are to be identified, so that their impact may be decreased.

## Layers Of Consciousness

There are multiple layers to consciousness, which can be thought of as the physical structure of an onion. At the core, there is nothing but the self, the "I", which may be considered a blank canvas, one which has not taken in any experiences and which has not acted out on its environment. At this level, no desires, no fear and no suffering exist.

Contrary to popular belief, life does not begin at so-called "birth", but rather already began many months prior in the mother's womb. Mistakes of the mother may have added layers of negative effect to the baby's core before it first got to see the light of day. Even if no physical actions have taken place yet, the way this conscious being has handled its experiences so far resembles choices.

### Decisions Alter

With each new decision, brought about by either an external event, or an internal one, such as a drive or a desire, new experiences add to the stack of layers, which in turn affect the core, and thus the degree to which free will can be exercised.

Not only consciousness is altered, but also the brain itself may deform by what is known as neuroplasticity. The saying that "whatever you focus on grows" refers to these two alterations, where that of the brain can be interpreted as a way to increase efficiency for repeatedly executed and thereby required tasks. I view it as a realization of potential, as not all potential can be realized within the limited space of a skull.

The omnipresent law of inertia again concerns these alterations as it does everything else, so that they cannot happen instantaneously. Thereby it is to be concluded that decisions of any kind will evoke long-term effects on their executor, and are not to be taken lightly.

### Switching Layers

Various intakes all throughout the day may cause a switch in regards to the layer currently in control of the situation, which mostly stem from external events. With enough mental discipline and some practise, it becomes possible to willfully cause such a shift, as is often the case when meditating or concentrating.

The further inwards one tries to relocate consciousness, the harder it becomes to stay there, as outer layers became deprived of attention and will eventually make themselves known again.

## Missing Knowledge

As already presented in [The Nature Of Thinking](/philosophy/the-nature-of-thinking), free will may only go as far as the available knowledge at that point in time allows for. In order to realize ideas physically, where ideas are mental instantiations of elements within the space of possibilities, one needs to know how to formulate a pathway of actions, in order to arrive at the desired destination. This is the exact reason for why I think that we need to make all knowledge available centrally, in a well-organized manner, for free, since [No Man Is An Island](/philosophy/no-man-is-an-island) and thereby everybody depends on the derived knowledge of their predecessors.

### Knowledge Of One's Nature

Every species has its own characteristics, as in anatomical limitations, the reproductive process, as well as its main purpose within the clockwork of nature. The reason for why I do not think that consciousness and the body are to be considered as one unit is the fact that we do *not* know about these characteristics since birth, but that we rather need to study them as soon as the brain has been developed far enough to do so.

Well, to be fair, we would be taught by nature, as every other animal is, through feedback-systems and the pleasure-and-pain responses we have to them, but we degenerated to a point where we can no longer trust these systems in order to derive knowledge, let alone do we live a life in nature, as we should.

This essential biological knowledge then allows further derivations to take place, by deriving [Knowledge Of The Knowledge](#missing-knowledge_knowledge-of-the-knowledge).

#### Natural Drives

Natural drives occur and thereby try to impose behavior whether we know about their underlying concepts or not. They include:

- The drive for social connections and acceptance
- The drive to have enough food and drink available
- The drive to reproduce
- The drive to have shelter
- The drive to sleep

These cannot only be interpreted the wrong way by an out-of-tune organism, but also be misused in a way which causes negative feedback long-term, and thereby needless suffering, even if short-term feedback lands on the positive side of things. By having [Knowledge Of One's Nature](#missing-knowledge_knowledge-of-ones-nature), in conjunction with [Knowledge Of The Knowledge](#missing-knowledge_knowledge-of-the-knowledge), one becomes enabled to rise above these primal drives, in order to unfold their untarnished free will.

### Knowledge Of The Knowledge

This *meta*-knowledge tells us what to make of the [Knowledge Of One's Nature](#missing-knowledge_knowledge-of-ones-nature), how to interpret it, and how to satisfy the needs which underly to and make up our drives, without having to compromise on the clarity of the free will, and without ending up in negative loops. I'm going to try and formulate examples of this concept.

#### Nourishment

Our anatomical limitations dictate which food we are supposed to eat, as described in [The Pinnacle Of Evolution](/philosophy/the-pinnacle-of-evolution), while the reason for us having tastebuds in the first place is as follows:

- To tell apart spoiled from fresh food
- To tell apart healthy from poisonous food
- To trigger a pleasurable response as a motivation to eat

As soon as we molest our tastebuds as well as our whole food-tube with the wrong food, with addictive substances, with flavors and scents which have never existed before, we will enevitably become addicted to this way of living, and thereby become gluttons. By knowing what these bodyparts were intended for originally, one can reverse their degeneration, and once again live as nature intended them to, in effect liberating themselves from the drive to make their whole existence revolve around culinary perversions.

Yet another mighty inside would be [Piece 112 of The Ultimate Schematic](philosophy/the-ultimate-schematic#piece-112), as it tells us that we have to first undergo a process of reversing the tolerance we've built up to our mistakes, before any unadulterated judgment may take place.

#### Reproduction

Every species on this planet aims to not go extinct, and thereby has an inherent interest in reproducing itself. Since natural selection also manifests within what an individual feels attracted by, namely by others of high aesthetics, their strength, their endurance, their social status, etc., these expectations have irreversibly taken root within our subconscious a long time ago.

First of all, by knowing why this drive exists, it becomes obvious that it, just as [Nourishment](#missing-knowledge_knowledge-of-the-knowledge_nourishment), is not to be misused for deriving pleasure from, as talked about in [Chained To A Madman](philosophy/chained-to-a-madman), if one wants to avoid needless long-term suffering. Being on the wrong path is always visualized by the lengths one has to go to in order to repeatedly carry out their actions on a large scale. Having to wear a condom, having to take "*the pill*" or having to undergo vasectomy all point out that we have turned against nature.

Secondly, it seems like this system does not account for or take note of the fact, that there exists a point of success; a point after which most members of the species no longer need to think of reproduction as their number one goal, and the species has established its longevity on this planet. We have far surpassed this position in time, and thereby should now liberate ourselves from the chains this drive has imposed on our free will.

We no longer need to honor these superficial criteria as a common notion of individual value, but rather acknowledge the importance of intellect and wisdom. We need to stop reducing our highly facetted members to their sexual organs, thereby dulling the lens, which in turn leaves one wandering through pitch black darkness, instead of unfolding their free will and finding likeminded companions to revolutionize, with united forces, our comicly absurd way of living as a species.

#### Molecules Of Emotion

While it was intuitively logical that emotions would manifest physically within the body through molecules of lock-and-key communication systems, and that the body may also affect the emotional state, thereby making this exchange of information bidirectional, the book "Molecules Of Emotion" by Candace Pert put some scientific insights and support behind these claims.

From this directly follows, that a sick body can ruin emotional stability and well-being, as well as that chronic negative emotions can act corrosively to the whole system.

#### Imprints And Associations

The neural network within the brain constantly associates knowledge, experience and emotions in order to store them in an accessible manner. Habits and imprints all lead back to neuroplasticity and resemble automata which make reoccurring actions less thought-heavy, as consciousness requires a lot of resources.

Once a (bad) habit or imprint is about to be dismantled, the flywheel of inertia (metaphorically speaking) becomes slowed down, and withdrawal symptoms will make themselves known. This period is to be endured in order to re-liberate one's free will. Knowing that this process is inherent to a physical body can aid the motivation of withstanding temptation.

## Missing Mental Clarity

Mental clarity should be the number one goal of each and every individual on planet earth, as it gives rise to the ability of making mindful decisions.

"Watch your actions; they become habit. Watch your habits; they become character. Watch your character; it becomes your destiny." - Lao Tzu

No matter how much wisdom has been accumulated, how much sharpening one's intellect underwent, how much the inner flame to revolutionize the world flares up; without mental clarity, the exchange of information within consciousness itself and between it and its environment is just too obstructed to come anywhere close to its full potential.

Mental clarity can be dampened by a body that's not up to task, as consciousness always relies on a vehicle. This could be the case through so-called "*dis-ease*" brought upon by the wrong way of living, which includes behavior-altering substances like alcohol, drugs and the wrong food.

On the other hand, mental clarity may be thought of similar to a muscle: it needs to be regularly exercised to keep its potency. Indulging in escapism and thereby fleeing from- and denying one's own purpose in life will slowly reverse any prior invested effort of mental exercise.

## Induced Uncertainty

It's very challenging for the individual to rise above the ideas of its time, because one is constantly bombarded with so many references, so many beliefs and dogmas, as well as the effects of peer pressure and the pain received through socal exclusion.

People who go against the mainstream, for example by practising abstinence, namely from sexual activity and or from gluttony, act as a mirror to those who still indulge in these distractions; a mirror which provokes the implicit question of "Why are you depending on it, why do you need it?". As soon as the revolutionary reap what they've sown, as soon as their life starts getting better, those who initially questioned their decisions are now proven otherwise, and start to feel jealous and ashamed.

If the message cannot be attacked, the messager is to be taken down. People become ridiculed, alienated, libelled and excluded from society: misguided fools do not want to dwell next to a living and breathing reminder of their own shortcomings.

While there are many who still manage to unfold a lot of their potential in complete isolation and in spite of this mental suffering, others are crushed by it; people who are desperately needed as helping hands to push through a revolution, one which has been long overdue. This is the exact reason for why it is of paramount importance for those who are strong enough to shine their light, to become beacons of hope and inspiration, to stand like a rock in the surf in a world that has been flooded by conflicting opinions, lies, deception and misinformation. Through pillars like these, beings who are still held back by the chains of uncertainty may derive a feeling of validation, of valuable acceptance and, in the end, of empowerment to finally act out on their intuitions.
