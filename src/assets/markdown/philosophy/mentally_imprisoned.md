(A huge *thank you* goes out to whoever has drawn this amazing artwork above - I merely edited it to my liking, but sadly couldn't locate the true author while browsing the web. I cannot even begin to express how well it captures my life-long struggles.)

Since my mental health has steadly been getting worse due to how mental imprisonment gets harder to deal with as time goes on, I really feel the need to get some of my omnipresent worries off my chest, as I'll go through a little "therapy-session" with myself; if you do not suffer similar anguish, you probably shouldn't continue on reading this page.

Starting out at the very first memories of my life I still hold access to, I have been vastly differing from my peers. The fact that our interests and our drives diverged to a degree where we had almost nothing in common caused me to become a misfit on a regular basis. As I was sill young, naive and philosophically incapable, I wanted to escape this state of painful alienation with all my might and gave my best to fit in or to make people like me: I became the so-called "class-clown" and allowed others to treat me disrespectfully, just so I could be part of the crowd in one way or another; this got me into trouble on the regular, getting my parents called up into school, deeply disappoing them over and over again - a deadlock type of situation, as it was all I had to make life bearable.

It took lots of thought and many years, way into my teens, until I realized that what I became was not in sync with who I really am: an introverted, quiet, peaceful and philosophical as well as scientific thinker. I do not want to be the doormat of others simply to have them acknowledge me as a person - instead I accepted my alienation and shifted all of my attention to making progress on what I truly believe in. While I got lucky during one period of my life and actually had what I'd call friends, this decision made me become the lone wolf I am today, making isolation become my new norm and nominating darkness as my new steady companion.

Things did eventually get better, but not without yet another price to pay: sharpening my wit and increasing my level of consciousness (in the true meaning of the word, not some esoterical hogwash) also made my level of disappointment and disgust regarding society and the sick and twisted world they've created skyrocket beyond good and evil. Many of these realizations caused me to experience severe depression, which I could only mitigate by once again escaping into the mental realms of science and engineering - by keeping myself otherwise occupied. There is no way I can express using mere language how disheartening, how heart-wrenching, how devastating and how soul-crushing it feels to truly understand the potential of humanity and the possibilities within this realm all while full-well knowing that I will never be able to attain them or to unfold myself to a level even close to that, simply because I'm weighed down by my severe depression, mental illnesses as well as all of the sickness and suffering around me.

Over all, as unbelievably as it may sound, I am still proud of myself for having chosen that route, as it increased my intellectual reach, so to speak, beyond what I could have ever imagined while being stuck in the situation of my younger self. As a philosopher, I successfully detached myself from a whole host of primal or "human" drives on a long-term basis - yet I cannot seem to manage to quench the life-long and most sincere desire of wanting to be truly and profoundly understood at least once by another person before my body decays. As every being does, I too constructed a personal mental sphere of sanctuary - a place where I do not need to masquerade, where I am not disappointed and saddened by others and where I store as well as organize all of my experiences, insights and exact reasons for why I ended up as the person which now pours their heart out in this very article.

Even if it was for the life of me, I do not think I could ever pin-point why it is of such high importance to me to share this sphere with somebody else - somebody who had endured a similar pathway and thus becomes enabled to not only view, but to also step foot into my very own realm and vice-versa. Part of it probably stems from the fact that I would wholly view this stay on earth as pointless, if it wasn't for the exception of purpose and meaning coming into existence as soon as beings can make each others' stays (as unwillingly imposed by reck- and thoughtless practitioners of the reproductive procedure) bearable or in some extreme cases even enjoyable by lessening the other party's suffering, making them feel understood or even loved and working towards the greater goal of making the world a less horrible place together.

While I have put in the effort to try and reach out countless times whenever I was under the illusionary impression of my opposite being compatible with me, each and every instance of these desperate and painful attempts has not only ended up in a heartbreak and burned my soul, but also continually broadened my understanding of why I believe this to be a desire impossible to attain. With every year of me waking up in the same shoes on the daily, my levels of dull- and bitterness steadily climb; it becomes harder and harder for others to connect to me on a meaningful basis, as the impenetrable shell grows thicker and thicker, trying to defend my already beaten-down self from all instances of becoming vulnerable due to interpersonal relations.

On the other hand, for all of my life, I observed how distant (relative to my ideal standards) people behave, how they're stuck in long-term self-protective mode - declining, rejecting and simply avoiding attempts of me trying to put forth genuine acts of affection. Whenever I felt comfortable enough to reveal my true philosopical, highly thought-active and plainly put just conscious personality, my opponents reaction was either negative or simply just not in any worthy proportion to what I tried to communicate and how much energy and effort it took me to do so. As I've stated quite a few times in other articles on my page, from my point of view, the majority of this population does not profoundly differ from mere automata, having had their behavioral patterns wired by others of influence a long time ago, simply reacting to sensory inputs like a neural network would; they do not often stand back to reflect on their choices, try to put themselves into the shoes of their opponent, or simply seek a constructive meaning of life; also, their "decisions" have no solid foundation to them, making them inherently unstable and fluctuating - I simply do not want to put myself into the hands of such non-self-aware beings.

I am well aware of the fact that many of my critiques regarding others also apply to my own way of living - this insight is adding to my mental burden and causing massive amounts of despair; what if we, as a species, have crossed the point of no return? What if I can merely critique, become aware, but not cause any noteworthy change in myself? How could I then ever expect others to align with the ideals I so desire? This thought alone makes my stomach turn, so for the time being, I try to avoid it by looking for ways to still make a difference, despite hopeless circumstances marking the status-quo.

Not only the above renders my long-term goals seemingly unattainable, but there's yet another factor which I would have never even considered before finding myself in this exact situation: the overwhelming majority already leads lives which keep them busy as well as distracted and possibly even find themselves within a support-structure of friends and family to some degree; how could they ever bring the required time, dedication, persistence and interest to the table as would be required to build up a truly profound and meaningful interpersonal relation with somebody like myself? So many already possess year-long friend- or relationships - by simple logic, these people cannot be compatible with me, as I will never manage to build up a comparable level of trust and affection, simply due to the fact that this procedure takes time and that said other relations are already so far ahead of what I could initiate; I will forever remain their - at best - second choice; and no matter how childish that may sound - being somebody's alternative for when their main interests experience a downtime is causing me to be more miserable than if I was simply on my own. Amongst all of these beings dwelling planet earth, how many of them actually reached a level of mental isolation coming even close to that of my own? Likely not many, I dare to assume, based on the emperical evidence I managed to gather during the span of twenty-odd years.

Even if I would be lucky enough to ever get to know somebody who truly is compatable with a scarred and isolated being like myself - how would I ever signal to them the level of sincerety my intentions hold? After all, I could just as well be yet another disappointing heartbreak, from their point of view; maybe I am already too far gone as to be able to make this kind of jump. Often times I simply stop and ask myself what exact reason remains to still continue on and endure this hell-hole of an existence on a daily basis and if it wasn't for the ever-so-small shard of hope to one day be profoundly understood and possibly even loved by somebody else, I would fully give in to the perception of viewing death as a salvation, as a relief, as something to look forward to. I'll try to once again collect myself during the following few days and keep on keeping on, living a life based on nothing but hopes and dreams - cause' what's the alternative? ;)
