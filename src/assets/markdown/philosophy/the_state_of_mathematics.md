### Key Characteristics

Mathematics is a mental science, meaning that the study regards mental objects, which are in no way bound to the physical world whatsoever. In comparison to natural sciences, where experiments performed on reality are essential to derive new knowledge, a mental science can be conducted with nothing but thought alone. The reason for why we use physical means to aid this process is twofold: on one hand, our mental capacities are severly limited, and on the other, thought is inherently fluctuating and thus needs to become captured.

(The following key characteristics of proper, well-defined and rigorous mathematical concepts have been put forth by John Gabriel; you can find out more about him and his works at the [New Calculus](/math/new-calculus) page.)

Mental concepts can be communicated or conveyed from one mental being to another. Being A can construct an object of arbitrary complexity and - if its description is carefully and exactly crafted - being B can obtain this exact same object to then further work with it on their own. Later down the road, B can share its result with A, and they may even compare their findings.

Such a concept is only as appealing as it is well-formed. The following four essential requirements may validate any definition:

1. Must be reifiable **(R)** either intangibly or tangibly.
2. Must be defined in terms of attributes **(A)** which it possesses, not those it lacks.
3. Must not lead to any logical contradictions **(C)**.
4. Must exist in a perfect Platonic form. What this means, is that it exists independently **(I)** of the human mind or any other mind, as a noumenon of course.

**RACI**: **R**eifiable - **A**ttributes - No **C**ontradictions - **I**ndependence

To reify means to produce an instance of the concept, so that someone who knows nothing about it, can understand it exactly the same way as any other. If one can't reify a concept, then it may possibly not exist outside of their mind. If it is impossible to get past this first step, the concept at hand is no doubt nonsensical.

If a concept is not defined in terms of the attributes it posesses, then one may as well be takling about innumerably many other concepts. Thus, there is endless ambiguity. An attribute describes the boundaries or limits, the extent of the instatiated object from the concept.

> Mathematicians are like artists, the objects arising from concepts in a mathematician's mind are only as appealing as they are well defined.

Once a concept has been reified and defined, it has to be vetted; There are limitations to being well defined, and this is why one needs to undergo checks for contradictions, until the concept becomes *axiomatic*, meaning it established itself over a long-enough time-period of vetting. Any implications of the concept must not produce logical contradictions.

The last criterion states that the concept must exist outside of the human mind, or any other mind. For example, if aliens realize the *incommensurable* constant $\pi$, they will realize it in the only logical way: the attempted measure of a circle's circumference magnitude using the diameter magnitude as a unit. Perfect concepts exist whether life exists or not. This exact knowledge is what the Greeks discovered when they were studying geometry; without any exception, all of these are perfect concepts (Platonic).

### Discovered Or Invented

Imagine a square, which is characterized by the fact that all of its sides are of equal length, and the angles spanned by pairs of two joined sides each are right angles. Even if, without further complex research, one cannot determine the length of the square's diagonal line, it is most definitely constrained and does not differ between different individuals who imagine the square. Its value, or rather formula, is fixed, was always fixed and will always be fixed, from the beginning of time, until the end of time.

We, as conscious, mental beings now enter the adventure to discover various properties of countless mental objects. Before this journey, we were ignorant to them, and afterwards, we gathered knowledge and broadened our horizon.

The five requirements in the beginning of Euclid's "The Elements" should not have been called postulates or axioms, as they have not been invented; they follow directly and rigorously from the concept of a point, asking the question "Where?". The only "postulate" there is consists of assuming an empty three-dimensional universe, to which a conscious observer, as well as another point of reference are added. Perfect concepts, called noumena (singular noumenon), have always existed, will always exist and continue to do so even if no conscious being thinks about them. Once the journey of discovery is taken on, beings separated by both space- and or time will come exactly to the same conclusions, if their methods were truly rigorous. This simple fact answers the question whether aliens would use the same mathematics as we do: yes, of course! Well, at least the part of it that's well formed; if they'd ever make it here, they'd surely not fall for the infinity-riddled feverdreams modern academia considers our highest intellectual goods.

Mathematics is the science of measure and number, and nothing else. There is no room for subjective choices or opinions.

> ("It is not a refinement, but rather a defacement of the sciences if one allows their boundaries to converge.")

What has been most definitely *"invented"* is the way in which we communicate these mental objects. To use a blackboard, a piece of paper, wax tablets, or even modern computers as an extension to our mental space are choices we made, based on what was and is available within our surroundings. A circle, drawn by a compass, is not equivalent with the mental object of a circle. On a blackboard, it would merely be the residue of chalk left alongside a curved pathway.

### Formalization

To formalize a mathematical object means to express it without making use of ambiguous means of communication, as in natural languages or - to some degree - even (complex) geometrical constructions. By depicting these objects as strings of symbols from a fixed, well-defined and agreed-upon alphabet, higher precision may be achieved and details which would otherwise be lost become captured. A proof can now be written down as a sequence of strings of mathematical symbols, where each string is stating one exact relationship. These strings nonetheless tend to be surrounded by explanations within natural languages (mainly english) to aid the understanding of their reader, and to get a hold of the thought-process of their discoverer.

Next to the property of exactness, another great advantage is the fact that the process of validating sequences of strings of symbols has now been turned into a mechanical process which computers can take care of. Illogical conclusions can be discovered automatically.

### Applications In Reality

To re-iterate: mathematics is the science of measure and number. From this instantly follows why the theorems of this science "apply to reality". Scientists observe and measure, then make use of mathematical models, to finally derive further insights or make predictions.

If a mathematical object turns out to be a close-enough approximation to a scientific process, then all theorems which hold true for said object will also apply to the approximated process. This property allows scientists to be substantially quicker in spotting behavioral patterns within the universe which would not be visible to the naked eye alone. With all of this accumulated knowledge at our disposal, we can then run simulations of the real world, using our models, and thereby attain great predictive precision.

Personally, I think that it is of utmost importance that we do not confuse approximations with reality, no matter their apparent precision. Even if our models work well and have revolutionized our abilities as a species, we must not give in to the arrogant urge of feeling superior, feeling like we're in control, like we're the operators of reality. It seems as though many scientists believe that they are bending the universe to their will, when they - for example - *"force"* electric current to carry out calculations through the application of relays, tubes, transistors and the like. This false sense may only increase with the ascension of so-called "quantum computing", where we now reach even deeper into the inner workings of reality to *"misuse"* them for our desires. When viewed soberly, it becomes evident that no matter what we discover or *"invent"*, it was there all along, within the space of possibilities, offered freely by the universe. We cannot force it to do anything it does not already offer by itself. Only because our models work well as approximations, we must not conclude that this is how reality works "under the hood", so to speak. Instead of behaving arrogantly and trying to reach beyond our insights, we should show gratitude, be open for new knowledge and acknowledge other logically sound theories which we have not yet been able to neither prove nor disprove.

## Problematic Decisions

### Elitarianism

As with all new knowledge, the knowledge of mathematics tempts its wielder to think higher of themselves, in comparison to all of those who are not yet aware of it. No matter which situation arises, this superiority can be made use of to derive self-confidence, which acts as a means to compensate for other insufficiencies in life.

The inherent need of human beings to become part of a higher cause, or rather to become part of an environment that's inaccessible to others, in return creates the need for elitarianism. In the case that this special and still hidden knowledge would reach the masses, it would not remain being neither special, nor hidden.

While it of course is of great importance that mathematics develops its own domain-specific vocabulary, next to a well-defined set of symbols, these properties are - sadly enough - often times applied to the detriment of newcomers to this science. Instead of explaining theorems to their full extent, crucial details are knowingly (even if sub-consciously) left out and are taken as a given, to make things look more difficult than they really are. Further, fundamental and important questions are often times laughed off and taken as evidence of the lacking intelligence of their questioner, when exactly those lead to the real and profound understanding of the subject.

If the current, entire state of mathematics would be stored in a publicly accessible, central library, broken down into step-by-step derivations, so that everybody could study them iteratively on their spare time, and thus no theorem would remain impossible to grasp, the self-conviction of a multitude of mental scientists would suffer great damage.

This highly egotistical way of going about things is greatly slowing down our progress as a socienty, since countless bright and creative minds are disposed of a great deal of their potential. If it would be possible to derive our current state of progress as a whole within a single lifetime, without any external help or information, then this act would be proving that all of our mathematical predecessors were plagued by insufficient ability and intelligence. Since this assumption seems highly grotesque, I brand it as being illogical and thus conclude, that it is merely impossible for a single mental being to catch up to all progress, let alone come up with new theorems afterwards. We are depending on each other, since we are in dire need of the knowledge of our predecessors, in order to not end up in an endless loop of trying to derive the same knowledge over and over again. It is our responsibility to meet this need and thereby to immortalize the established knowledge for the next generation to come.

Since mathematical derivations are comprised of a multitude of individual steps, and due to inertia on one hand, but also due to the requirement of creativity on the other, which is inherently fluctuating, no single step can happen instantaneously. It can be concluded, that there will always be a minimum duration attached to each derivation. If one is aware of the sheer endless amount of theorems in existence, then it will quickly become apparent why a single mental being will be crushed under all of this weight. The scene noticably changes though, if we manage to take creativity out of the equation by providing a stepwise derivation of each theorem, so that they can be comprehended in a successive manner rather quickly. While it is still impossible to take possession of our current knowledge as a whole, the individual's reach was drastically increased.

Knowledge should not be hidden behind courses, schools, universities or even books, which all come with either monetary and or temporal responsibilities, but rather be public property. We should not be sabotaging each other, but give our best to support one another to flourish as a society.

### Subpar Organization

Not only are scientists making up for the vast minority of the population, but this set still shrinks in size if we only consider those, who truly and deeply understand their niche of the field. How will we ever avoid loosing knowledge, if we don't immortalize it centrally and publically, while we fail at conveying it to our offsprings, and while these scientists are going to leave this earth some day? While this is a serious problem in present times, I think that it also says a lot about us, as a species, considering our current progress after having existed on this planet for such a *long, long* time.

You cannot skip steps the path to scientific enlightenment, which is why it is of paramount importance that we do not only capture our current state of knowledge, but also the ways which have lead up to it. Usually, if a theorem has been established for the first time, there's still room for improvement left. Not only that, but with more time, more progress manifests, which allows us to come back to previous theorems and not only rework and extend them, but to also find completely different ways which lead up to their result. These are often times considered mathematical identities, where two different expressions point at the same mental construction. It is also necessary to capture these alternative routes, as a lot of insight can be derived from them, but to then go ahead (as many teachers and professors do) and act as if any pathway other than the original is sufficient to derive, prove or introduce a theorem is not only pedagogically reprehensible, but also simply perverted.

Next to the need for historical knowledge as described above, I also believe that we owe it to the first discoverer of each theorem to remember their name and their personal story. While we're at least doing better on this part, some of this knowledge is still unrecoverably lost in the ether.

To really guarantee that all these details are captured and preserved forever, a very specific datastructure seems to be the natural solution: *a fully versioned tree*. The root node consists of as little postulates, definitions and axioms as necessary, and is followed by the atoms of mathematics. From these, all theorems in existence span outwards, linking back to all other theorems which were used while deriving them. Each time an update is being made, only the difference is stored, to later provide a differential view. Theorems go through stages, and all of these stages should be remembered, while updates need to be commented and justified. Such a tree would explode in size rather quickly, which is why organization as well as partial and filtered rendering become very important. A structure like this would easily identify circular proofs and truly separated disciplines within mathematics, while established bridges would stand out and aid the understanding of their viewer. This world could be explored in a recursive fashion, where topics of interest can be studied down to a tee. Different people could specialize in various subfields, which is by design impossible in classrooms or lectures, as one or two teachers just don't have the resources to accomodate each and everybody. The need for crowded and overall depressing (from the viewpoint of dedicated students) classrooms would fade, and students could learn either on their own, or in small groups, in places they feel most comfortable.

While this is a goal too big to ever near completion within a single being's lifetime, various highly appreciated long-term projects only came to be because a single person pushed the idea forwards in the beginning, doing all of the hard work. I'm very much convinced that it is not yet too late, and that there is still hope in getting this utopia manifested from my daydreams into reality.
