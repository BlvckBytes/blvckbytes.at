## Introduction

I recently got a good deal on a used *Elegoo Saturn 2 8K* SLA 3D-printer. At the moment of writing this, the device sells for around 400 euros brandnew, while I got mine for 220 euros used, in good and working condition.

To be honest, I'm not (yet) into 3D printing, and thus haven't bought the printer for that reason. I saw another, in my opinion hugely underestimated, capability of this printer, which comes into existence due to the fact that it has a monochrome 8K LCD built into it, right above a Fresnel lens, bundled with a UV light source. This *screams* PCB fabrication to me.

Here are the display's specifications:

```
7680x4320px
218.88x123.12mm
891.23 dpi
28.5Âµm/pixel
```

I've seen $.15\mathrm{mm}$ traces done successfully with less pixels, so I have good reasons to believe that this could be the holy grail of rapid prototyping at home.

## Repeatable Alignment

When 3D-printing, a bath of resin is required, from which the structure can be incrementally built out of, layer by layer. This is what the container looks like out of the factory:

This container does not align with the outermost pixels of the display, which is why I would have to either leave this part of the PCB unexposed, or add shims. Both ways are not a realistic option for me, which is why I've decided to build my own alignment jig. For this, I've used only remaining parts I had lying around, some of which came from my [Customizable Tool Wall](/engineering/customizable-tool-wall).

The first step was to add the following two parallel vertical rails, onto which I can then variably mount the two horizontal stops.

Now I only need a way to connect these aluminium profiles together, while still leaving some freedom for adjustments.

For this exact purpose, I've made some slotted pices of flat aluminium:

Just three more...

Through these, I can join the rails and adjust their distance if ever required.

The right-angle profile is joined to the c-profile by two M3 screws, for which I've drilled the holes at $3.2\mathrm{mm}$. This way, I've got approximately $\pm\frac{1}{10}\mathrm{mm}$ of play, both upwards and downwards. I've adjusted them so that the aluminium rails are slightly suspended above the LCD, and thus excert zero force onto it. A little post-it will slide just through the gap, but a PCB won't:

If I ever need to 3D-print something, the whole thing comes off with just the two M4 screws on the right-angle profiles' slots and stays rigidly calibrated.

### Calibration

I started by putting a post-it on the LCD and drew a line closely to where the first pixels of the display are located at.

Then, I ensured that the rails were parallel to the housing, as that's parallel to the display, and noted the distance to repeat it equally on the other side.

Using the rail as a ruler, I drew another line.

The lines were parallel, and their distance came down to $4.5\mathrm{mm}$.

After calibrating the left rail analogously, I set the mounting screws at a calculated distance, so that the horizontal stops will end up at the same distance from the first pixels of the display.

In the end, all measurements lined up well enough for what I'm trying to do.

With these stops mounted, the final usable space of the display comes to be roughly `210x114mm`. Since standardized blank boards are around `160x100mm`, I can still expose full PCBs, if I ever need to.

## Projecting A Layout

The mainboards of these printers, along with their firmware, have been designed by `ChiTu Systems!`, which went above and beyond to make sure that their product is as locked down as possible. There is no straight-forward way to project a bitmap onto the built-in LCD, as the printer seems to only accept `.ctb` files, which are the result of slicing a 3D-Model with the `Chitubox` software.

This means that I need to extrude my bitmap into a 3D STL to then slice it into layers, so that the printer accepts the data. What a time to be alive! If this whole idea pans out, I'm going to try to come up with a proper solution for this tedious process.
