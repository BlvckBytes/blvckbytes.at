## Introduction

For quite some time, I kept all of my tools piled up in plastic euroboxes. This did not only cause me to procrastinate a lot on my projects, as I had to search for specific tools each and every time, but also ensured that all of my work-surfaces became a mess, as I couldn't quickly store something away when no longer needed.

I really thought that these fancy magnetic tool strips from amazon were the solution to all of my problems, after having heard so many reviewers talk about them.

And to their defense, they were quite okay-ish, with the big disadvantages of not only collecting metal filings like crazy, but of also not holding on to non-ferromagnetic materials (obviously). Some of my tools just didn't fit into this scheme at all, by - for example - being too big and thus blocking out too much horizontal or (even worse) vertical space. I needed way more storage than this, but these strips got expensive rather quickly when scaling up.

**These ain't cutting it!**

## Solution

After some research, I came accross a [solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dredPWrXOI) by [Svens Werkstube](https://www.svens-werkstube.de), a channel I've already been following for a little while. Their idea instantly captured my attention, and I got to work a few days later. I *knew* that this would be the ultimate solution.

## Implementation

At first, I began by alleviating myself from the pain of having to drill every hole into a "high-density" concrete wall, which was accomplished through wooden spacers that then act as the main support. They also provide some ventilation behind the boards.

Due to it's size and the availability at my local hardware store, the board got segmented into four tiles.

Each of these received three vertical slots for aluminium C-profiles to slot into. I've removed the material using a router and sanded to the desired fit manually, with sandpaper.

After quite some intense labor, the slots have been completed,

and could now be populated with their corresponding aluminium profiles:

The next task was to cut, drill and file the horizontal bars, which are made out of the same c-shaped profiles.

These, in combination with some "c-slot-nuts" and a few star-grips made for some highly customizable grid bars:

The times of having to struggle with statically distanced tool holders is now officially over, as I can configure these bars to wherever my tools require them to be.

As I planned on storing some rather heavy tools on this wall, I thought about how to reinforce these aluminium profiles. A bit of flat steel, drilled, tapped and mounted to the profile, reinforces the bar itself, while a screw right through the horizontal middle taps into a nut driven into the back of the wooden panel. These nuts are at regular distances between vertical slots, so that there is enough flexibility to decide on where the heavy tools go.

The same idea allowed me to mount a whole bunch of screw clamps onto this wall as well, which are made of heavy steel.

## Final Results

After having had this wall up for a few months now, and after having changed things around a gazillion times, this is the final layout I've ended up with.

Next to the wall, on the right hand side, I've added a few more frequently required accessories.

While on the left hand side, there are some wrenches, as well as the more heavy-duty screws of my stash.

Over all, I'm **more than happy** with this wall. It has proven itself useful beyond what I could've ever envisioned at first, and I cannot imagine working without it anymore. It has boosted my productivity quite a lot and allows me to get into flow state faster by saving me from having to go through piles of unorganized tools over and over again.
