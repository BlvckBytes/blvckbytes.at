## Overview

I was born in Austria (üá¶üáπ), right at the beginning of the year 2001 (01.01., `:)`) and have been given the name `Philip`. After some years of wandering through the web and after many trials to come up with a nickname I identify with, `BlvckBytes` was and still is what resonates the most. My nickname links two words which are of great importance to me, one of them being the standard unit in information technology - the byte - and the other being blvck, which is an obscured way of writing black, with the a being on it's head. The latter is a reference to darkness, a steady companion of mine, having turned my existence on it's head numerous times.

I'm very open-minded and always give people or new concepts a neutral base to build upon, but I'd describe myself very much as a non-typical kind of person, as my interests as well as my drive in life vastly differ from those of most beings I've had a chance to meet so far. While my peers always loved to indulge in all the various stimuli and pleasures life has to offer, boasting about their "achievements", this kind of lifestyle has always repulsed me and induces a deep down feeling of sadness and disappointment. While I don't find myself attracted by physical appearances to any meaningful degree, I very much am attracted to people which haven't lost their curiosity and make use of their ability to apply logic to solve problems.

In order to clear my thoughts, I really enjoy to go for a run or do some calisthenics, but I'm by no means an athlete. I use physical exercise as a fun way to help me concentrate and view problems I'm facing from a different viewpoint, while keeping my vehicle operational. It provides a feeling of true freedom and rootedness for me. During summer time, I go for bicycle rides where I really push myself to the limit.

As I'm very much appreciative of not only having shelter but also cling like crazy to my laptop, I cannot exactly claim to be a hard-core minimalist in the typical sense. On the other hand, all of my long-term goals and desires cannot be bought with money, but instead require a mixture of hard mental and physical effort as well as a sprinkle of good luck. To me, the true experience of life takes place on the inside, within the realms of thought and consciousness. I am not one to go on shopping sprees or to dream about climbing the ladder of career in order to earn the big bucks. If I ask myself which lifestyle choices would bring a smile to my face on my deathbed, the outcome is always the same: finding like-minded companions, providing help to others and fighting for a better world, together.

## The Past

My teenage years were mostly made up of dark episodes due to my parents fighting all the time, being a social outcast, having health issues and most importantly: feeling anguished by my strongly clouded mental state.

A few years ago I found myself in the midst of rewriting my book of life. The first and most impactful propulsion came from a radical dietary change. The second biggest milestone on my journey was marked by the discovery of philisopy and - what I call - mental alchemy. I managed to finally break this cloudy barrier, unfold my free will and feel like I have an impact on the movie played in front of me.

"I was blinded and numbed out by the misery which my mental and physical ailments brought upon me. What was obvious or naturally given to others has been invisible or unattainable to me. This time has been lost and I have been scarred. May philosophy now allow me to heal my soul and body as well as to regain a multiple of my losses." - Philip Hell

## The Present

I'm still far from being able to unfold my true potential. On a good day, or rather during good moments, I can think clearly, and can get a taste of what I'm actually able to accomplish. Sadly, while the situation improved a lot, these kind of moments are still far and few between. Through mentioned dietary changes, I could notice a huge impact within my ability to think clearly within one or two months of consistently doing what I feel and know is right (a large set of theoretically and empirically derived insights). This lightness, clearness and wakedness opened a new space of problems to me, one which I would've never thought about: seeing the suffering of myself as well as of others on this planet more detailled, becoming truly aware that I will likely never be able to attain long-term happiness, not due to the nature of reality, but due to the imposed and artificial rules and systems in place. Because of this conflict, the longest "streak" of fruitarianism I've managed to attain so far was 60 days, where I went for an extended juice-fast. At other times, I use the wrong food (still vegan, (of course, I'd never go back,) but cooked) to numb myself out, and it makes a *huge* negative difference... The reason I do so is the exact same reason for why some poor souls commit suicide: they can no longer deal with their level of pain and suffering, the pain exceeded the beauty of life. I'm aware of some possibilities on how to break through this barrier, I still see light at the end of the tunnel, and I'm aware of how death is a one-way-street, so that's *not* happening.

Not only that my body still isn't up to the task, because I'm not permanently behaving as I should (in combination with piss-weak genetics), but I'm also still fighting with so many traumata and negative experiences which haunt me to this day, that I cannot seem to escape the ideas of my space, of my time, of my prison. It's like I'm trying to get out of quicksand, repeatedly struggling, but not getting very far. On the positive side, I've had just a finger out two years prior, while I'd be confident calling it an elbow's length by now, `:)`. Babysteps... it'll accumulate.

My traumata consist not only of how society has dealt with me, but also of how I responded. I've went down so many stupid rabbit-holes, made a fool of myself, spent time with people and concepts I never should have, and am now haunted by their residue. In some sense, I'm also holding myself back from breaking that barrier as a way to punish myself, as there's still some self-hatred deep down within me. But hey, at least I managed to stay clear of drugs and will never go down *that* route. Cooked food's bad enough, `;)`.

So, to make a long story short... If you read what I wrote on this page, if you read my code, if you look at my work in general, and if you're of astute personality, you'll see this mental anguish all over it. I'm sorry, I try my best. The reason for why I still put my work out there is not to impress people, which I not only do not care about, but also never will, but to maybe one day attract likeminded companions, so we can fight for what's right together.

## Favourite Quotes And Inspirations

These are in no particular order, and I'd have many more around... If it wasn't for these people, I wouldn't know where else to draw my inspiration from. If I've left a quote untranslated, within the German language, it is because I feel like it would loose it's potency otherwise. Feel free to use a translator though.

"Auf hohem Berggipfel lag verborgen, das Leben ohne Leid, Schmerz und Sorgen. Durch Nebel, Wolken und an d√ºstern Gr√ºnden, ward wenigen verg√∂nnt, den rechten Pfad zu finden. Gar manche st√ºrzten ab und viele geh'n zur√ºck: in Angst verzichtend auf des Lebens h√∂chstes Gl√ºck. Auf halber H√∂he und mit halben Lehren, will jeder dann die Welt bekehren. Und alle rufen sie im Chor vereint: Wir glauben nicht, dass oben Sonne scheint!" - Arnold Ehret

## Interests

I consider myself a *world-jumper*, as I call it. There's no single interest I'm chasing all the time, but I'm rather going for "sprints" in various worlds of topics. Sometimes, these take only a few days or weeks, sometimes months. I don't constrain myself in any way, shape or form. If I don't feel inspired and motivated to work on something, I just don't do it, as I'd otherwise pollute that world with negative experiences.

Most of the worlds I'm jumping between are the following:

- Software engineering (plugins, web front-&backend, tools, libraries, applications)

- Electronics design (PCB-design, PCB-fabrication, front panel design, soldering, low level software engineering, automation, repair)

- Fabrication in my workshop (CAD-modelling, cutting, filing, drilling, threading, welding, spray-painting, etc.)

- Exploring math and logic (reading, solving scientific puzzles, building my own little library of knowledge - trying to learn from ground zero)

To sum it up, I'd say that I love exploring how the world around me operates and then use that knowledge to summon small creations of my own into reality.
