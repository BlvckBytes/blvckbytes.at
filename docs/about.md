# About Me

## Overview

I was born in Austria (ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¹), right at the beginning of the year 2001 and have been given the name `Philip`. After some years of wandering through the web and after many trials to come up with a nickname I identify with, `BlvckBytes` was and still is what resonates the most. I am very open-minded and always give people or new concepts a neutral base to build upon.

## The Past

My teenage years were mostly made up of dark episodes due to my parents fighting all the time, being a social outcast, having health issues and most importantly: feeling anguished by my strongly clouded mental state.

A few years ago I found myself in the midst of rewriting my book of life. The first and most impactful propulsion came from a radical dietary change. The second biggest milestone on my journey was marked by the discovery of philisopy and - what I call - mental alchemy. I managed to finally break this cloudy barrier, unfold my free will and feel like I have an impact on the movie played in front of me.

"I was blinded and numbed out by the misery which my mental and physical ailments brought upon me. What was obvious or naturally given to others has been invisible or unattainable to me. This time has been lost and I have been scarred. May philosophy now allow me to heal my soul and body as well as to regain a multiple of my losses." - Philip Hell

## Interests

I consider myself a *world-jumper*, as I call it. There's no single interest I'm chasing all the time, but I'm rather going for "sprints" in various worlds of topics. Sometimes, these take only a few days or weeks, sometimes months. I don't constrain myself in any way, shape or form. If I don't feel inspired and motivated to work on something, I just don't do it, as I'd otherwise pollute that world with negative experiences.

Most of the worlds I'm jumping between are the following:

- Software engineering (plugins, web front-&backend, tools, libraries, applications)

- Electronics design (PCB-design, PCB-fabrication, front panel design, soldering, low level software engineering, automation, repair)

- Fabrication in my workshop (CAD-modelling, cutting, filing, drilling, threading, welding, spray-painting, etc.)

- Exploring math and logic (reading, solving scientific puzzles, building my own little library of knowledge - trying to learn from ground zero)

To sum it up, I'd say that I love exploring how the world around me operates and then use that knowledge to summon small creations of my own into reality.
