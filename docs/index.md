# Welcome

Greetings! Feel free to take a gander at what little content I currently have to offer.

This site mostly serves as a creative outlet for myself and is **not** intended to be a "professional portfolio" (far from that, actually). I am (and will likely always be) an amateur scientist, so please don't be offended by my lacking ability of formulating rigorously correct documents.

I am adding pages and content whenever I feel the urge to and have the required time left.
