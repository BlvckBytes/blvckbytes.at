# Personal Goal

My personal goal in the field of math is to create my own little library of knowledge, which leads you step by step through the whole derivation, no assumptions taken.

I envision a graph, almost like a dependency tree. Each theorem or simple statement is only allowed to make use of it's predecessors, where the root node is consisting of a few definitions and postulates.

This graph should be fully viewable, zoomable and thus explorable, while each node links back to the nodes it makes use of.

This way, the most highest and most complex of mathematics can be expressed recursively in the most simple terms. No more "recipes", no more "school math".

This is a big goal, probably even a life worth of work. I'm taking it one step at a time, building up a little library on this page to hopefully one day clean it up into said tree.

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) looks like a good tool for the job, as I love markdown in combination with LaTeX and some hand drawn sketches, so maybe this will be my tool of choice.
