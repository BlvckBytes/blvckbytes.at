# Angles

Angles, which are formed by two rays (sides) that share a common endpoint (vertex), are called plane angles. Their magnitude is what's then referred to as an angle, where the word stems from the Latin *angulus*, meaning corner. In most cases, these quantities are assigned Greek letters as variable names.

## Notation

Three points fully identify angles, and are denoted as follows: An angle with vertex $A$, formed by the rays $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{AC}$ is denoted $\angle{CAB}$.

There are, however, a few ambiguities which arise with this just-introduced notation. Let's define $\alpha$ and $\beta$ as follows:

<img src="/img/angles__2.jpg" class="third-width-image"/>

The angle $\angle{BAC}$ might refer to any of the four cases (where it's direction determines it's sign - [Signed Angles](#signed-angles)):

- The clockwise angle from $B$ to $C$ about $A$: $-\alpha$
- The anticlockwise angle from $B$ to $C$ about $A$: $\beta$
- The clockwise angle from $C$ to $B$ about $A$: $-\beta$
- The anticlockwise angle from $C$ to $B$ about $A$: $\alpha$

The context of many geometrical situations makes it quite obvious that the positive angle less than or equal to $\pi$ is meant. Other than that, a convention arose which states that $\angle{BAC}$ always refers to the anticlockwise angle from $B$ to $C$ about $A$ ($\beta$) and that $\angle{CAB}$ represents the anticlockwise angle from $C$ to $B$ about $A$ ($\alpha$).

## Signed Angles

Since angles often times represent orientations and/or rotations in specific directions, making them relative to some reference, it is useful to have their direction be determined by their sign.

In a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, the angle is usually defined by its two sides, with its vertex at the origin. The *initial side* is on the positive x-axis, while the other side or *terminal side* is defined by the initial side in radians, with *positive angles* representing rotations toward the positive $y$-Axis and *negative angles* representing rotations towards the negative $y$-Axis. This way, *positive rotations* are anticlockwise and *negative rotations* are clockwise.

As seen above, the coordinate system is just layed "on top" of the origin, with it's x-axis aligned with the *initial side*.

## Measurement

The size of an angle is usually the magnitude of the smallest rotation that maps one of the rays into the other. Angles of same size are considered to be equal in measure or congruent. In some contexts, like identifying rotation, angles that differ by an exact multiple of a [Full Angle](#full-angle) are effectively equivalent.

To measure the angle $\theta$, a circular arc centered at the vertex of the angle is drawn with a pair of compasses. The ratio of the length $s$ of the arc by the radius $r$ of the circle is the number of *radians* in the angle:

<img src="/img/angles__8.jpg" class="third-width-image"/>

$\theta = \frac{s}{r}\mathrm{rad}$

Conventionally, the radian is treated as being equal to the dimensionless unit $1$, thus being omitted. One radian is defined as $r = 1$ and $s = 1$, making $\theta = \frac{1}{1}\mathrm{rad}$. Since the circumference of a circle of radius $1$ is $2*\pi$, one turn equals to this value.

### Degree

The degree, denoted by a small superscript circle ($째$), is $\frac{1}{360}$ of a turn, so one turn is $360째$. One advantage of this sexagesimal (base 60) unit is that many common angles can be expressed in terms of whole number of degrees.

### Arcminute

The minute of arc, or just minute, is $\frac{1}{60}$ of a [Degree](#degree), so $\frac{1}{60} * \frac{1}{360} = \frac{1}{21600}$ turn. It is denoted by a single prime ($'$). For example, $3째30'$ is equal to $3$ degrees plus $30$ minutes, so $3 + \frac{30}{60} = 3.5\mathrm{deg}$

### Arcsecond

The second of arc, or just second, is $\frac{1}{60}$ of a [Arcminute](#arcminute) or $\frac{1}{60*60} = \frac{1}{3600}$ of a [Degree](#degree), so $\frac{1}{3600} * \frac{1}{360} = \frac{1}{1296000}$ turn. For example, $3째7'30''$ is equal to $3$ degrees plus $7$ minutes plus $30$ seconds, so $3 + \frac{7}{60} + \frac{30}{3600} = 3,125\mathrm{deg}$.

## Individual Types

### Zero Angle

Refers to an angle equal to $0$ or *not turned*.

### Acute Angle

Refers to an angle smaller than a [Right Angle](#right-angle) ($< \frac{\pi}{2}$). The word "acute" means "sharp".

### Right Angle

Refers to an angle equal to $\frac{1}{4}$ turn ($= \frac{\pi}{2}$). Two lines that form a right angle are said to be *normal*, *orthogonal* or *perpendicular*.

### Obtuse Angle

Refers to an angle bigger than a [Right Angle](#right-angle) ($> \frac{pi}{2}$). The word "obtuse" means "blunt".

### Straight Angle

Refers to an angle equal to $\frac{1}{2}$ turn ($= \pi$). Two lines that form a straight angle are *parallel* and *coincident*.

### Reflex Angle

Refers to an angle bigger than a [Straight Angle](#straight-angle) ($> \pi$) but less than $1$ turn ($= 2*\pi$).

### Full Angle

Refers to an angle equal to $1$ turn ($= 2*\pi$) and is also called a *complete* or *round* angle, or a *perigon*.

### Oblique Angle

Refers to an angle that is not a multiple of a [Right Angle](#right-angle). The word "oblique" means "skewed".

## Pair Types

### Complementary Angles

Angle pairs called complementary are pairs whose measures sum to one [Right Angle](#right-angle). If these pairs are [Adjacent Angles](#adjacent-angles), their non-shared sides form a [Right Angle](#right-angle).

<img src="/img/angles__4.jpg" class="third-width-image"/>

$\alpha = \angle{BOC}$<br>
$\beta = \angle{COA}$<br>
$\alpha + \beta = \frac{\pi}{2} = \angle{BOA}$

The adjective complementary derives from the Latin *complementum*, associated with the verb *complere*, "to fill up". An [Acute Angle](#acute-angle) is "filled up" by its complement to form a [Right Angle](#right-angle).

### Supplementary Angles

Angle pairs called supplementary are pairs whose measures sum to one [Straight Angle](#straight-angle). If these pairs are [Adjacent Angles](#adjacent-angles), their non-shared sides form a [Straight Angle](#straight-angle) or a straight line.

<img src="/img/angles__5.jpg" class="third-width-image"/>

$\alpha = \angle{BOC}$<br>
$\beta = \angle{COA}$<br>
$\alpha + \beta = \pi = \angle{BOA}$

Such angles are called a *linear pair* of angles.

### Explementary Angles

Angle pairs called explementary are pairs whose measures sum to one [Full Angle](#full-angle). They might also be called *conjugate angles*. The *difference* between any given angle and a [Full Angle](#full-angle) is termed the *explement* of the angle, or the *conjugate* of the angle.

<img src="/img/angles__7.jpg" class="third-width-image"/>

In the above scene, $\beta$ is the difference between a [Full Angle](#full-angle) and $\alpha$.

$\alpha = \angle{AOB}$<br>
$\beta = \angle{BOA}$<br>
$\alpha + \beta = 2 * \pi$

### Vertical Angles

When two straight lines intersect at a point, four angles are formed. A pair of angles opposite to each other are called *vertical angles* or *vertically opposite angles*.

<img src="/img/angles__6.jpg" class="third-width-image"/>

$\alpha = \angle{BOA}$<br>
$\beta = \angle{COB}$<br>
$\gamma = \angle{DOC}$<br>
$\delta = \angle{AOD}$

Due to [Supplementary Angles](#supplementary-angles), the following relations are established:

$\mathrm{I}$: $\gamma + \beta = \pi$<br>
$\mathrm{II}$: $\gamma + \delta = \pi$<br>
$\mathrm{III}$: $\alpha + \beta = \pi$<br>
$\mathrm{IV}$: $\alpha + \delta = \pi$<br>

From the equality of $\mathrm{I}$ and $\mathrm{II}$ follows, that:

$\gamma + \beta = \gamma + \delta \Rightarrow \beta = \delta$

From the equality of $\mathrm{I}$ and $\mathrm{III}$ follows, that:

$\gamma + \beta = \alpha + \beta \Rightarrow \gamma = \alpha$

By adding $\mathrm{II}$ and $\mathrm{III}$ it follows, that:

$\gamma + \delta + \alpha + \beta = 2 * \pi$

### Parallel Vertical Angles

If a line $\overline{AC}$ intersects with two parallel lines $\overline{BD}$ and $\overline{B'D'}$, the same reasoning as in [Vertical Angles](#vertical-angles) applies, with some additional information.

<img src="/img/angles__9.jpg" class="third-width-image"/>

Because of [Vertical Angles](#vertical-angles) it follows, that:

$\alpha = \gamma$<br>
$\beta = \delta$<br>
$\alpha' = \gamma'$<br>
$\beta' = \delta'$

Since $\overline{BD}$ and $\overline{B'D'}$ are parallel, they both intersect $\overline{AC}$ in the same angle $\alpha$ and $\alpha'$, thus follows:

$\alpha = \alpha'$<br>
$\beta = \beta'$<br>
$\gamma = \gamma'$<br>
$\delta = \delta'$<br>

So, in short, both sets of angles are completely identical.

### Adjacent Angles

Adjacent angles are angles that share a common vertex and just one common side.

<img src="/img/angles__4.jpg" class="third-width-image"/>

In the scene above, the angles $\alpha$ and $\beta$ share the common vertex $O$, while the common side is $C$, which splits the angle $\angle{BOA}$ into $\alpha = \angle{BOC}$ and $\beta = \angle{COA}$.
