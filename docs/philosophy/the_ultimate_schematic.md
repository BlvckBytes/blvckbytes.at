## Introduction

This representation of *"The Ultimate Schematic"* (alternatively called *"The Epiphany Maker"*, *"A Six Box System"*, *"Plato's Map On Bottom, Hero's Map On Top"*), as brought into existence by [John Rose](https://www.youtube.com/@JRawRose) (see [The Ultimate Schematic Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIWo2dGh9fzkWFLe0CuUzIcxqPwLDa8L8) and [The Ultimate Solution Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIWo2dGh9fzmCboXxHwrqq-KCpJ__-0pd)), is intended as a reference work, to be shared, talked and thought about. This information has been collected by watching many of the available videos and scratching together what's readable as well as what has been spoken about. On some occasions, I might have augmented this information with my own understanding of it in order to make it more reachable for newcomers. While I gave my best to represent the diagrams in a responsive manner, they are still best viewed on a computer screen. If there are any problems regarding this page, any questions or ideas for improvement, please contact me at my email *blvckbytes@gmail.com*.

People are encouraged to challenge this schematic, to try and either find flaws in it and/or to come up with additional pices and to put them where they may fit. This webpage is always a WIP, as I'm still working on learning about all the pices.

### 100% within our control

The things we do: lifestyle choices

### not 100% within our control

The things done to us: Accidents and acts of nature (no control), war, crime and violence (limited control)

## The Ultimate Schematic

The ultimate schematic represents three stages of knowledge on two event horizons: The right path (paradise), where we have no problems within our control, and the wrong path (plato's cave), where we have hundreds of thousands of problems that are 100% within our control. As a species, we don't have the knowledge to know the difference. We have been tricked and fooled into believing that most of our problems are outside of our control.

The purpose of this schematic is to help us understand where we are, where we came from, how we got here and how we get back where we need to be. We cannot go back the way we originally came, because we fell down 109, when we applied something we mastered to something we needed.

There are six horizontal/vertical doorways, four diagonal gateways, and eight portals, making up 18 connections between the six boxes. It has 281 pices total (might not be the latest count), 69 are in 18 portals, 212 are in six boxes.

212 pices come from 128 main pices, that come from 25 main pices, that come from 5 main categories, where we have 14, 5, 3, 2, 1, respectively. First four groups are in the first stage of knowledge (24 and 24), then we add pices 1 and 2. The second and third stage both on the right and wrong path have the first two groups and the last one, that's 19 and 1.

101 and 103 are there to hide pices in. 19 in 101, 19 in 103, to make things simpler. Either within our control or outside of our control. 24 + 24 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 = 128, 128 + 4 + 60 + 20 = 212 Pices in 6 boxes. 4 added pices to hide pices and 80 duplications.

## Definitions And Backgrounds

### Paradise

Paradise is simply the absence of problems which are 100% within our control. Having the right knowledge, making good applications and thus ending up having unlimited potential. It is *not* anything special in the sense of just snapping your fingers and having wishes just manifest out of thin air. We still need to work on our dreams and goals in life.

### Plato's Cave

In the allegory "The Cave", Plato describes a group of people who have lived chained to the wall of a cave all their lives, facing a blank wall. The people watch shadows projected on the wall from objects passing in front of a fire behind them and give names to these shadows. The shadows are the prisoners' reality, but are not accurate representations of the real world. The shadows represent the fragment of reality that we can normally perceive through our senses, while the objects under the sun represent the true forms of objects that we can only perceive through reason.

Socrates explains how the philosopher is like a prisoner who is freed from the cave and comes to understand that the shadows on the wall are actually not the direct source of the images seen. A philosopher aims to understand and perceive the higher levels of reality. However, the other inmates of the cave do not even desire to leave their prison, for they know no better life.

### Science Of Solving Problems

The science has to do with our first group of needs: the law of cause and effect (linear). It is about satisfying 12 essential needs, thereby removing the primary causes and represents the knowledge of how to live. If we nurture the trees of life and keep them separate (not applying what we mastered to what we need), they in turn nurture us. The science focuses on the oneness of disease, based on our anatomical limitations we have been given at birth.

### Art Of Solving Problems

The art has to do with our second group of needs: the ripple effect (circular). It is about two additional, temporary needs, thereby dealing with subsequent causes as well as subsequent needs and represents the knowledge of how to adapt. If we alter the trees of life and mix them up (applying what we mastered to what we need), they in return alter us. The art focuses on the uniqueness of disease, based on the anatomical limitations we have brought upon ourselves by making mistakes and having damaged our anatomy as well as the environment. These additional, temporary needs are going to change as conditions change and can vary between and even within individuals.

### Tipping Point

It's not easy to break away from the herd for most of us, which is why we have to reach the tipping point. Otherwise, things will never change. We got to get enough of us to complete the first step in order to get everyone else's attention. No man is an island, correcting this mistake on an individual level is not going to solve all of our problems. Nobody has the right to bring the rest of us down, yet the vast majority of us are bringing all of us down.

There are three waves of heroes, where the first wave consists of the trim tabs of society, which have to step up and test an idea who's time has come. They have to be an example and help us reach the tipping point, so that the second wave of heroes can reach on.

### Trim Tab

Currently, our ship is steered towards an iceberg, constantly accelerating into hell. On a ship that big (analogous to the world's population), even the rudder used to steer the ship has too much inertia to control it directly. The trim tabs are the rudders on the rudder, which slowly but steadily redirect the main rudder, and thus the over all direction of the ship.

### Law Of Cause And Effect

Just like all matter is subject to Newton's third law of motion, the law of action and reaction, all living systems (like all animals, *including* humans) are subject to the law of cause and effect. If we don't satisfy our needs and apply what we've mastered to what we need, it only logically follows that we in turn alter us. Denial and ignorance are not going to withhold the consequences of bad lifestyle choices, they may only postpone them.

### What Are Problems

Problems are negative effects and reside in the third stage of knowledge on the wrong path: in plato's cave. There are either problems which are 100% within our control, or problems which we only have limited control over. We don't get a problem unless we make a mistake. There are two ways to make mistakes: Not applying what we know or applying false knowledge.

Problems serve a purpose. Knowledge is acquired in the first stage, applied in the second stage and manifested in the third stage. Problems are a part of the effects, the third stage. They are supposed to tell us whether we're on the right or on the wrong path and are an essential part of the pleasure and pain feedback system.

When we look at our problems, we have to work backwards. If they are outside of our control, we cannot do anything to them and have to treat their symptoms. Otherwise, when the problem is within our control, we don't want to treat the symptom, that would be putting the cart before the horse. You have to remove the cause.

### Performance Equation

Performance equals ableness times willingness. Ability is knowledge and skill. Skill is applied knowledge as well as mental and physical dexterity. And then, we got those seven willingness factors. The ability to perform is limited by these seven obstacles.

### A Hero

A hero is somebody that can solve a problem nobody else can solve. If a problem is self-inflicted, then who is the hero? It's you!

### Hypoheliosis

Hypo means low, helio means sun, together standing for an abnormally low biophoton level. Type A is on an individual level, type B is on a collective level.

### Anti Nutrients

Most of the plants which are consumed nowadays don't want to be eaten and have defense mechanisms in place. We should be hugely irritated by these plants and get sick quickly, to learn our lesson, but are either destroying these defense mechanisms by the sin of cooking or by genetically altering the plant. Some of these anti nutrients also block or inhibit proper use of our needed nutrients, which would lead to deficiencies and thus to problems, showing us the mistake.

### Denial

Denial is shadowing those unwanted aspects of our lives because we'd go crazy otherwise. It's a defense mechanism. We run to denial to protect our pleasures and deny the fact that we have a sick society where psychopaths are running the asylum. They're just a reflection of us, we all need to change.

### Human Existence On A Football Field

We need to understand - on the grand scheme of things - when we started making those mistakes. If we put the human existence on a football field, where there's one hundred yards and three feet and 12 inches:

We became civilized on the three inch line, which was all because of the 3rd mistake we made, on the six inch line, about 10k years ago. The very first mistake happened on the one yard line. The second mistake happened on the 2 1/2 foot line. The fourth mistake happened about 10 generations ago, on the 1/14 inch line. The fifth mistake is about 8 generations ago, about the 1/28 inch line.

TODO: Research this and maybe convert it to metric as well. Check the numbers!

### Our Anatomy

There are about a dozen anatomical characteristics that determine where all animals fit relative to how they interact with their environment: especially what they eat. We've got carnivores, omnivores, herbivores, grainivores, *frugivores*. We have the exact same anatomy as all plant eaters. The most convincing evidence is the length of our intestines. They are approximately 10 times the length of our body, because we have to process fiber. Carnivores and omnivores have intestines that are approximately 3 times the length of their body, no exception. Flesh is going to take three days to go through you. The right food should be out the next day. Food with a slower bowel transit time will cause backing up and thus hyper colonic tension, seeping back into the body. The shape of our teeth are another obvious giveaway. Grains are the reason for why so many vegetarians/vegans are not healthy either. We're not biologically adapted to eat grains, we're not grainivores. There is only one group of animals on this planet that are true grainivores: the birds, having special organs to digest grains. Cows are not supposed to eat grains too, yet we feed them corn and soy. This changes their omega3-to-6 ratio, now most flesh eaters get this inbalance passed onto their bodies, causing more sickness.

### Level Two Nutrients

Another way to damage our bodies is by eating a diet which contains nutrients that would only be in our diet in it's precursor form, as it's a level two nutrient. If that's going on for long enough, our bodies can atrophy and not make it anymore. People of norwegian ancestory have been eating so much fish that they got so much DHA that they no longer make it on their own and are now dependent.

## Pices

### Pice 1

Not having the knowledge we need, the knowledge of how to live. This number is surrounded by a dotted circle, because we used to have it within our +A circle of knowledge (inside the circle: the knowledge we have, outside the circle: the knowledge we don't have), but we've lost it.

### Pice 2

We have false knowledge in the place of the right knowledge we need. We cannot learn anything if we think we already know. Most of us don't know that we have an inaccurate believe system. We're making mistakes that are causing most of the problems we're facing, which are 100% within our control. These things are hard to accept, because they go against what we are, how we identify, what we've been told, our traditions, and many more things (two forms of ignorance).

### Pice 3

The number one source for false knowledge is the dark side of our behavior. We became immensely greedy. The psychopaths who are running this asylum go out of their way to make sure we're staying sick and ignorant. This is the number one obstacle of finding the right knowledge and has many agents all throughout other pices.

### Pice 4

Traditions. Society attacked early when the individual was helpless. Before we were even able to walk and talk, our parents taught us the same mistakes that were taught to them. All of our problems begin in childhood and can be traced back to our traditions, making us already start out our life in plato's cave. When you look at your traditions, they include all accumulated wisdom, but also all accumulated mistakes. All the good things about our species can be reflected in the wisdom and all bad things in the mistakes.

### Pice 5

A malfunctioning survival mechanism. We cannot trust our feedback system anymore. See Pice 112.

### Pice 6

Fear, due to low biophoton levels (Hypo-Heliosis). It destroys our ability to think clearly, which is the first step anyone must take in order to solve any problem. Fear comes from the very first mistake we made, when we destroyed a nutrient that destroyed one of our senses. Deep down, we know that something is wrong, which is why we turn to the wrong food, or sex, or drugs, or money, or relationships. We're searching for a warm and fuzzy feeling, to make us feel better, but we're looking in the wrong places.

### Pice 7

Six subsequent needs, which are a result of being sick and disconnected. There are ten subsequent needs from having a weak connection to everything around us, and six of those can be used against us. All of our needs can be turned into weapon systems, which can be used against us. There is a common link between conquering nations and solving problems that are 100% within our control. How do we solve these problems? We satisfy our needs. How do we conquer nations? We don't let them satisfy their needs. This can be done overtly, like starving them out, or very subtly, as is done in modern civilizations all the time.

Looking for logical fallacies in systems with invalid structures and getting lost in the rabbit-hole of the details.

### Pice 8.3

Our so-called experts study the anatomy, chemistry and medications for lifestyle related problems

### Pice 8.4

The systems in charge are guilty of putting the cart before the horse for a problem that's 100% within our control.

### Pice 8.5

We look at our problems individually instead of collectively: we don't apply the concept of totality.

### Pice 8.6

When people don't use the parable format. A parable is a story told in a specific way to make a single clear point. If we don't tell the story in a special way, people are going to shut off their frontal lobes, will have a mental processing error and are not going to accept the information.

### Pice 8.7

People only use two of the three ways (water fast, organic raw vegan diet) to correct five main mistakes. The problem there is that most of us are not willing and able to do those things, in order to get everyone's attention. The solution that enough of us are willing to do is the juice fast, a modification of what used to be the best preparation for a better way of life.

### Pice 8.8

When we focus too much attention on anything else but getting reconnected, and thus are getting distracted.

### Pice 9

The combination of our neocortex and our reptilian brain. With all new knowledge comes the potential for evil, when the things we've mastered are applied to the things we need. And that's exactly what we did. The reptilian brain can get addicted to everything that's pleasurable, while our brilliant brain can come up with seemingly infinite ways of creating the illusion of pleasure.

### Pice 9A

Our brilliant brain: the neocortex. About 2 million years ago, our brains nearly doubled in size and gave us the ability to quickly and efficiently gather new knowledge. It slowly kept growing, to a point where we started making mistakes, and now are evolving backwards again.

### Pice 10

A lack of continuity among those of us that understand that we're making mistakes. We end up shooting inside the tent, so to speak.

### Pice 11

We've lost our natural instincts. It shouldn't be any harder for us to figure out what to do than it is for any other animals in nature. We shouldn't have to use our brains to figure that out. Now that we've made mistakes, we created another group of needs that we need to satisfy, so we *do* have to use our brains now. As soon as those temporary needs are no longer there and we're healed again, our feedback system should be telling us everything that we need to know. In this state, it's a problem of knowledge, because we cannot rely on our experiences.

### Pice 12

A lack of knowledge of the cleansing reactions. When we correct mistakes, we get these type of reactions, and will feel worse before we feel better. So if we're doing the right thing, we think we're doing the wrong thing, because we're getting a negative effect. Flu-like symptoms, headache, fever, nauseating feeling, diarrhea, caughing, sneezing, aches and pains, etc., when all the body is doing is getting rid of accumulated toxins.

### Pice 13

When we have an emotional reaction before we have an intellectual response to new knowledge. This goes back to our reptilian brain.

### Pice 14

Our herd mentality that makes it hard to go against the main stream. The problem with that is that if we're heading off a cliff, we're all going to go off a cliff. Our ship is headed for an iceberg, and our herd mentality is to go right for that iceberg. We can use Pice 14 in combination with Pice 9A, our neocortex, to avoid that iceberg. We can take one of the five main things we've mastered, Pice 39 (Machines), and use that to modify what used to be the best preparation for a better way of life, pice 42. That's Pice 41, the juice feast. We can use what got us in trouble (our brilliant brain, as well as machines) to get us out of trouble. This way, our ship will turn around.

### Pice 15

Addictions

Denial

### Pice 17

Habits

### Pice 18

Apathy

### Pice 18.1

We're unwilling to admit that we have false knowledge and an inaccurate believe system.

### Pice 18.1.1

We're unwilling to admit that we have false knowledge in the place of the knowledge we need.

### Pice 18.1.2

We're unwilling to admit that we are making mistakes.

### Pice 18.1.3

We're unwilling to admit that most of our problems are 100% within our control.

### Pice 18.2

We're unwilling to search for information and knowledge.

### Pice 18.3

We're unwilling to listen to information.

### Pice 18.4

We're unwilling to believe the information.

### Pice 18.5

We're unwilling to apply what we know.

### Pice 18.6

We're unwilling to admit to our new experience.

### Pice 18.7

We're unwilling to share our new knowledge.

### Pice 19

Desires: What we'd like to (like to).

### Pice 20

Guilts: What we think and feel we should do (ought to).

### Pice 21

Emotional needs: What we'd need to (need to).

### Pice 22

Air

### Pice 23

Water

### Pice 24

Food

### Pice 25

Sunshine

### Pice 26

Exercise

### Pice 27

Sleep

### Pice 28

Unconscious as well as conscious thoughts

### Pice 29

Feelings and emotions

### Pice 30

Community and connectedness

### Pice 31

Being free from problems that are outside of our control like accidents and acts of nature & the elements. We also need to be free from problems that we have only limited control over: Acts of war, crime and violence.

### Pice 32

We need to procreate in order to keep our species alive and pass on our wisdom.

### Pice 33

We need an environment which we can interact with and which provides us with everything we need. Our ideal environment is nature in it's unaltered, non-toxic state.

### Pice 34

We have subsequent needs from being on the wrong path.

### Pice 34.1

Education

### Pice 34.2

Money

### Pice 34.3

Media

### Pice 34.4

Government

### Pice 34.5

Religion & spirituality

### Pice 34.6

Power

### Pice 34.7

Energy

### Pice 34.8

Infrastructure like plumbing and sewage

### Pice 34.9

Clothing (man is naturally a nude animal)

### Pice 34.10

Shelter

### Pice 35

We need to be free of subsequent causes that are still producing negative effects despite the fact that we are satisfying all of our needs. This includes temporary and permanent damage to ourselves and our environment, atrophy and thus dependence on level two nutrients (animal products), the dark side of our behavior, greed, etc.

### Pice 36

The first thing we've mastered is fire.

### Pice 37

The second thing we've mastered are animals.

### Pice 38

The third thing we've mastered is the agricultural revolution.

### Pice 39

The fourth thing we've mastered are machines, during the industrial revolution.

### Pice 40

The fifth thing we've only recently mastered are chemicals, during the chemical revolution.

### Pice 41

The only way to correct five main mistakes that enough people are willing and able to do, so that we can reach the tipping point: a solid food vacation on nothing but juices, also called a juice fast or a juice feast.

### Pice 42

A water fast used to be the best preperation for a better way of life. The best way to stop eating the wrong food is to stop eating at all. However, most people are afraid to death of waterfasting and would never do it. Waterfasting can nowadays be very dangerous due to the fifth mistake, the chemical revolution. There are so many toxins in our environment and thus in us, that, if we don't have the required nutrients in us (like glutathion), our liver cannot complete a two-phase process where it neutralizes and eliminates these environmental toxins. We don't get these nutrients from water, which is why we need to modify this step, using pice 9A (our brilliant brain) and modify the water fast into a juice fast. This way, we get results approximately 10 times faster, we're not hungry, energy levels skyrocket and big improvements are within reach. A waterfast basically requires to take a vacation from live, and most of us sadly do not have this luxury.

### Pice 43

Our ideal food: an organic raw vegan diet. Our ideal diet is only ideal in an ideal world, and thus needs to be adapted to compensate for the damage we've done to ourselves and to the environment. Eating this diet right after having made any (or all) of those five main mistakes is going to cause more cleansing reactions than doing a juice fast as a transition, to clean out the colon and use it as an alternative channel of detoxification.

### Pice 44

Knowledge of the consequences

### Pice 45

Experience of the consequences, see Pice 114

### Pice 46

The false believe that cooking is an art, when in reality, it is a sin.

### Pice 47

The false believe that we're flesh eaters and need animal products to lead a strong and healthy life.

### Pice 48

The false believe that the plants we're not biologically adapted to eat contain essential nutrients we need, ignoring all of their anti nutrients, only made possible through fire.

### Pice 49

The false believe that we can add to the perfection and completeness of the foods of nature by refining, combining, processing and thus - in essence - creating our own foods.

### Pice 50

The false believe that we need chemicals to artificially fertilize our soil, to spray our produce with, to wash our clothes with and that they are not entoxicating us and do not make our produce less vital.

### Pice 51

Addictions

### Pice 52

Denial

### Pice 53

Habits

### Pice 54

Apathy

### Pice 54.5

We're unwilling to apply what we know.

We're unwilling to share this new knowledge.

### Pice 55

Desires

### Pice 56

### Pice 57

Needs (7 willingness factors in the +A+B doorway)

### Pice 58

Bad luck - no control

### Pice 59

Carelessness - limited control

### Pice 60

The dark side of our behavior. The darkest of the dark side of our behavior.

### Pice 61

Clean air

### Pice 62

Pure water

### Pice 63

Natural, species specific food

### Pice 64

We need adequate, regular sunshine to produce important vitamins (or rather hormones) in our skin in order to function properly.

### Pice 65

We need adequate, regular exercise to keep our lymph system moving.

### Pice 66

We need adequate, deep enough, undisturbed sleep during the right time of the day: at night.

### Pice 67

Our conscious as well as our unconscious thoughts should be as positive as possible, since negative thoughts mostly manifest as negative emotions and create tensions, further restricting bodily functions.

### Pice 68

Our feelings and emotions, which are bound to molecules that traverse our bodies and can hinder natural body functions, need to be as positive as possible.

### Pice 69

We need an uplifting community, people to share things with that excite us, people to experience connectedness with. In this day and age, finding such a community is especially hard, as the trim tabs are the outcasts of "society".

### Pice 70

Free from things that are outside of our control.

### Pice 71

Appropriate sex/procreation

### Pice 72

An environment that can fully sustain us

### Pice 73

Subsequent needs from being on the wrong path, see 34.1-34.10

### Pice 74

Being free of subsequent causes that are still producing negative effects.

### Pice 78

Good applications of Pice 39

### Pice 79

Good applications of Pice 40

### Pice 80

Things outside of our control: acts of love and acts of kindness

### Pice 81

Polluted air

### Pice 82

Polluted water

### Pice 83

Un-natural food

### Pice 84

Inadequate sunshine

### Pice 85

Inadequate exercise

Negative thoughts

### Pice 88

### Pice 90

Irritated by things that are outside of our control or that we only have limited control over

### Pice 91

Lack of or inappropriate sex and procreation

### Pice 92

Polluted environment

### Pice 93

Lack of or inappropriate subsequent needs from being on the wrong path

### Pice 94

Subsequent causes that are still producing negative effects despite the fact that we've satisfied all of our needs.

### Pice 95

The first bad application was applying it to one of our needs: our food. It alters the food, which in return alters us. This caused Hypoheliosis A and thus a weak connection to everything around us as well as hyper colonic tension: two huge contributing factors to the dark side of our behavior.

### Pice 96

We're using fire to hunt down animals. We enslave them, eat their excretions (milk, eggs, etc.) and are eating their flesh, either raw or by applying fire to cook it. We are not biologically adapted to consume animal products either way. This mistake darkened the dark side of our behavior. There is evidence of this all throughout history. All philosophers and historians noticed that grain eating nations (not our species specific food, but still!) surpassed every other culture in every area of life, except two: in their war-like tendencies and their obsession with sex.

### Pice 97

The agricultural revolution allowed us to mass-farm and then consume plants we're not biologically adapted to eat. By cooking them, we destroy their anti nutrients and make them "edible".

### Pice 98

We consistently started to process our food thanks to machines, which now becomes unnatural and unhealthy.

### Pice 99

We began to bio-engineer plants, use artificial fertilizers, spraying our food with herbicides and pesticides and using chemicals all throughout the household as well as day-to-day life.

### Pice 100

Accidents and acts of nature, outside of our control

### Pice 101

Positive effects from things within our control (lifestyle choices, etc).

### Pice 102

Positive effects from things outside of our control

### Pice 103

Problems that are 100% within our control. We don't want to name these problems based on their symptoms (like doctors do), but rather by their causes!

### Pice 104

Problems that we have limited control over, like war, crime, violence, accidents and acts of nature.

### Pice 105

The -A-B doorway: Prisons and asylums are where we lock people up in order to keep them from acting out on their impure thoughts. This is also a trick, a magic act, not letting society witness and experience the severity of our degeneration.

### Pice 106

The -B-C doorway: This doorway is an automatic. Doctors give us drugs or poisons that interfere with the bodies communication process, things like hormones (insulin, thyroxine, etc.), anti-somethings, blockers as well as inhibitors. Our body uses a lock-and-key communication system. The receptorcites are like the locks and the communication molecules represent the keys. Inhibitors kill the keys or don't allow the body to produce those while blockers occupy the receptorcites and thus block the locks. This is a trick, a magic act. The feedback system is being hindered and mistakes don't manifest as symptoms, leading to more severe dis-ease down the road, as we don't change what we're doing.

### Pice 107

The +B+C doorway: An automatic, where we reap what we sow.

### Pice 108

The +C-C doorway: We manifest latent diseases, by going from the pleasure (103 in limbo) to the pain and suffering. Good example: cancer. Result of the -B+C gateway from building up a tolerance to our mistakes. Now we have cleansing reactions.

### Pice 109

The +A-B doorway (the fall of mankind): happens when we don't apply what we know because we're not willing or able to.

### Pice 110

The -A+B doorway: Acts of nature, forced fasting due to droughts, agents for 3 in 105

### Pice 111

The +B-C gateway: Agents for 3 in 107, cleansing reactions 108

### Pice 112

-B+C Doorway, We build up a tolerance to our mistakes and can now derive pleasure out of them instead of getting pain. We now get a 103 "in limbo", +C, instead of down in -C. These are latent diseases, they haven't manifested into pain yet. Agents for 3 in 106: dual effect of pleasure.

### Pice 113

+C+B worm hole: The positive causal loop, effects become causes.

### Pice 114

+C+A worm hole: The positive knowledge loop, effects become knowledge, where we gain experience from doing the right things. The ultimate solution.

### Pice 115

-C-B worm hole: -C's cannot become +B's, so they become -B's instead

### Pice 116

-C+A worm hole: We learn from our mistakes because we don't have pice 2.

### Pice 117

-C-B worm hole: Negative causal loop, negative ripple effect, catch 22 effect, 21 obstacles

### Pice 118

-C-A worm hole: The negative knowledge loop, where we perpetuate false knowledge.

### Pice 119

+C-B worm hole via the -B+C gateway: The negative causal loop, by going up 112: a false interpretation. Dual effect of pleasure via tolerance, caused by a malfunctioning survival mechanism. A 103 in limbo perpetuates pice 3.

### Pice 120

+C-A worm hole via the -B+C gateway: Perpetuating false knowledge, false interpretation from -C's or 103's in limbo

## Rose's Twelve Stories

### Story 1

The definitive answer to three of the most important questions we face as a species.

### Story 2

A very special teaching tool, created to answer these three questions and to show everybody where they are, where they came from, how we got here and how we get back to where we need to be. As well as showing where all the pices logically connect to all other pices.

### Story 3

A perfected three step process so that everyone can play their individual role when it comes to solving all of our proclems which are 100% within our control.

### Story 4

Step 1: Three ways of correcting five main mistakes, and we want to use only one of those ways that's doable by enough of us so that we can reach the tipping point.

### Story 5

Step 2: Five main mistakes we're making relative to five things we've mastered. First step addresses the willingness issue so that we can correct these mistakes on a temporary basis. The second step now corrects them on a permanent basis.

### Story 6

Step 3: Once we've added these mistakes onto our list of mistakes to correct, then we can take the third step, which is where we are going to satisfy two groups of needs. The science and the art of solving problems which are 100% within our control. The degree to which we satisfy those needs will be reflected in Story 7.

### Story 7

The condition of all four of our current status factors.

### Story 8

About the 21 main problems of knowledge.

### Story 9

Two doorways to find and to apply the found knowledge. -A+A to find the knowledge we need, +A+B to apply it. +B+C is an automatic, as we will reap what we sow.

### Story 10

Having a brand new reference.

### Story 11

Getting rid of 8.1

### Story 12

The realization that we are the heroes.
