# Chained To A Madman

While a multitude of behavioral degenerations manifested themselves over the centuries due to a sick and disconnected lifestyle, one of the most outstanding "traits" has to be the obsession with sex, right after number one: gluttony. For the majority of cases, this mania dominates males, even starting out very early in life. More recently, especially due to the lucrativity this sector of "entertainment" offers, women are increasingly drawn into the fixation just as well.

Some greek philosophers who practised abstinence described this drive in hindsight as "being chained to a madman".

## The Social Norm

It has become the accepted social norm that, if you're not interested in or even repulsed by sex, something has to be seriously wrong with you. An organism is considered to be malfunctioning as soon as *libido* (Latin for desire and lust) decreases. The more "experience" you managed to collect, namely the more you exercise your primal desires, the higher your social status rises. It is being frowned upon to practise sexual abstinence.

## Distraction And Superficiality

The reduction of an outstandingly complex lifeform to their sexual organs and physical appearance will result in the effect of viewing them through a dull lens. The observer is blinded by their obsession and thus cannot make out the opposite's true intentions, believes, purposes as well as character traits. This is (next to despair due to a sick society) the number one reason of why it is so common to project one's own values onto people "fallen in love with", only to then later on "fall from cloud nine", right after this *spell* shattered and *reality* has been revealed.

These superficial interactions, which later on become superficial relationships and - after many trials - may end up in superficial marriages, are only of very little value (philosophically speaking) and distract the intelligent consciousness from finding it's true purpose and pursuing it. A human being which matches the purpose of the obsessed may wait just around the corner, but cannot - due to dulled senses - be noticed and a so-called "water relationship" will not be entered within this poor individual's lifetime, being so distracted by "coca-cola-relationships".

## Wasting Energy

While it's natural to reproduce, the act of reproduction would only take place a hand full of times within the lifespan of a human being. This act is bound to the loss of seminal fluid and goes hand in hand with a firework of emotional and hormonal gland secretions within the bodies of both participants. It logically follows that these effects absorb a lot of energy and resources while also being - only if ever so slightly - corrosive to the system.

For the most part, sexual obsession demands daily or bi-daily intercourse or masturbation, so that the person suffering from it can keep their "sanity". It should not be hard to extrapolate that this designed as a once-in-a-blue-moon process will deplete the body if misused for pleasure over and over again, especially by people of less-than-ideal health.

There is an obvious tendency towards having to increase and further pervert sexual stimulation by the help of imagination (role-play, alternate persona, etc.), "toys", positions, as well as pain, suffering and other deuced practises. This vicious cycle of sensatory wearout cannot be escaped and will only lead to further separation from the true self.

## Being A Marionette

Sex not only sells - as is commonly known, but sex also controls. Every media is flooded by it, be it the newspaper, the radio, the TV, the internet or just plain old billboards. Sexually driven individuals can be steered to a certain degree in this way, by lowering their ability to think clearly and by luring them into a desired direction. As soon as somebody of interest is spotted, they are now the main objective. This ranges from brainlessly staring at strangers and stalking them, over doing anything in one's power to be "noticed" and "loved" and can end at the dark side of violent assaults if the requested results are not achieved consensually. Time flies by when in this state of mind, people don't seem to notice their loss. We're in such a state of denial that - as always - studies looking at effects in isolation tell us that it's healthy to regularly "release your seed".

## Clear Senses

Life becomes a lot more vivid once you leave these primal drives behind and stop wasting your energy. All of a sudden, people get depth added to them and one can actually start seeing their true personality, not being blinded by the imaginative thoughts of desiring intercourse all the time. This conserved energy can now be redirected towards personal goals and will thus help to expand the horizon with more ease.
